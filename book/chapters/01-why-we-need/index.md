* The fiat money system is broken (always has been).
* It is not sustainable (never has been).
* There is no way to fix it (never will be).

## THE (NOT) GOLD STANDARD

* Most people still believe that money is backed by gold.
* It is not.
* It has not been backed by gold since 1971, when President Nixon unilaterally took the world off the gold standard (the
  Nixon Shock).
* See wtfhappenedin1971.com to get a clear picture of the damage this did.

## FROM THE HORSE’S MOUTH OF OLDE

::: warning ""
The bank hath benefit of interest on all monies
that it creates out of nothing.

> ~ William Paterson, 1694, Founder of the Bank of England

::: warning ""
All of the perplexities, confusion, and distress in America arises, not
from the defects of the Constitution or Confederation, not from the
want of honor or virtue,
so much as from downright ignorance of
the nature of coin, credit, and circulation.

## THE FEDERAL RESERVE

* The Fed is the ‘independent’ central bank of the US. It was created in 1913 with the passing of the Federal Reserve
  Act.
* It has a unique structure, part private and part government.
* It is supposed to be a politically independent, non-partisan entity within the government.
* While the Fed Board of Governors is appointed by the President and confirmed by Congress, **the decisions
  of the Fed do not need to be ratified by anyone. Yes, it is confusing!**
