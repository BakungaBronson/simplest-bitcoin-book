# WHAT IS BITCOIN ?

>*“Writing a description for this thing
for general audiences is bloody hard.
There’s nothing to relate it to.”*

~ Satoshi Nakamoto 2010-07-05

>*Total circulation will be 21,000,000
coins. It’ll be distributed to network
nodes (miners) when they make blocks,
with the amount cut in half every 4 years.
first 4 years: 10,500,000 coins
next 4 years: 5,250,000 coins
next 4 years: 2,625,000 coins
next 4 years: 1,312,500 coins etc...
When that runs out, the system can support
transaction fees if needed. It’s based on
open market competition, and there will
probably always be nodes willing to
process transactions for free.*

~ Satoshi Nakamoto 2009-01-09

* **Bitcoin is freedom money…** in the sense that it has
the potential to free us all from the overarching
manipulation by, and control of, the central banking
system
* **In bitcoin, the monetary rules are the same for
EVERYONE, EVERYWHERE.**
* Bitcoin is inclusive, in the sense that anyone with an
internet connection can participate in the network,
and **has to play by the same rules.**

## bitcoin is:
* **DECENTRALIZED**         
* **TRULY SCARCE**          
* **CENSORSHIP RESISTANT** 
* **A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER**
* **INCORRUPTIBLE**
* PERMISSIONLESS
* AUDITABLE
* TRANSPARENT
* IMMUTABLE
* BORDERLESS
* HARD TO COUNTERFEIT
* PSUEDONYMOUS
* FRICTIONLESS
* TRUSTLESS
* PEER-TO-PEER
---
* Bitcoin is decentralized.
* **It is run on thousands of nodes worldwide, by thousands of people who don’t know each other.**
* No one person, government or company can ever
control it.
* You can run a node too, it’s easy ;)
* By running your own node, you increase your
privacy and help to secure the network when you
verify your own transactions.
> **Don’t trust. Verify**
---
* **Bitcoin (upper case ‘B’)** is a monetary network.
* **bitcoin (lower case ‘b’)** is the currency, or monetary asset, that is issued on, and runs on the Bitcoin
network.

---
* **Bitcoin is the great incentivizer.**
>* **The genius of Satoshi was such that in bitcoin, for
the first time, both good and bad actors are incentivized to play by the rules.**

> *“The incentive may help encourage
nodes to stay honest.
If a greedy attacker is able to assemble
more CPU proof-of-worker than all the
honest nodes, he would have to choose
between using it to defraud people by
stealing back his payments,
or using it to generate new coins.
He ought to find it more profitable to play
by the rules, such rules that favour
him with more new coins than
everyone else combined,
than to undermine the system and
the validity of his own wealth.”*

~ Satoshi Nakamoto 2008-10-31

* **Bitcoin is the first digitally native money,** unlike
your online checking account, which is just a
digital form of central bank fiat.
* Bitcoin is **decentralized** digital currency.
* Bitcoin has **no central authority.**
* Bitcoin is **stateless.**
* Consider the implications ...

>*Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables
instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world.
Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no
central authority: transaction management and money
issuance are carried out collectively by the network.*

* Bitcoin is magic internet money.
* No seriously, **Bitcoin is the way we are going to fix
the world.**
* Seriously? Yes.
---
* **Bitcoin is a way to transfer value**
 *  of any amount
 * securely
 * instantly (on the Lightning Network)
 * between any two parties
 * anytime
 * 24/7
 * anywhere
 * yes, anywhere
 * Think about that.

 ---

>*With e-currency based on cryptographic
proof, without the need to trust a third
party middleman, money can be secure and
transactions effortless.*

~ Satoshi Nakamoto 2009-02-11

>*Bitcoin is (almost) costless to move with certainty.
I know with 100% certainty what I am receiving.*

~ Michael Saylor CEO of Microstrategy

* You can send $1.13, or 46c or 359 sats or 500,000,000
sats or $1 million to anyone, anywhere, anytime
via the Bitcoin Network, or the Lightning Network
built on Bitcoin.
* **And no one can stop you.**
* Can you do that with gold, silver, USD/GBP/EUR/YEN/
CYK/ZAR or any other central bank fiat currency?

---
* **Bitcoin is historical.** This is the first time in history that
a truly decentralized, censorship-resistant, immutable,
borderless, permissionless, and incorruptible monetary system with an absolute hard cap (21 million
coins) has ever been created
>* Bitcoin is **as significant to decentralizing power
and increasing financial inclusion,** as the invention
of the printing press, and later the World Wide
Web, **was to decentralizing control of, and
increasing access to, information.**


>*A lot of people automatically
dismiss e-currency as a lost cause
because of all the companies that failed
since the 1990’s.
I hope it’s obvious it was only the
centrally controlled nature of those
systems that doomed them.
I think this is the first time we’re trying
a decentralized, non-trust-based system.*

* **Bitcoin is a distributed, decentralized, transparent
and immutable LEDGER OF ACCOUNT.**
* Anyone in the world can see who owns what, at any
given moment, and it cannot be changed.
* Except the ‘who’ isn’t a name, **it is an address
made up of numbers and letters.**
>* An example of a bitcoin address:
**bc1qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwf5mdq**

* Bitcoin is therefore **pseudonymous.**
---
* **Bitcoin is**
* an impartial issuer of assets
*  a store of value
* a medium of exchange
* and soon to be a unit of account
*  **as well as**
* **the means** of exchange.

* It is the issuer, the gold, the cash, the debit card AND
paypal, the bank, venmo, cashapp, western union

**ALL ROLLED INTO ONE!**

---
* **Bitcoin is a record keeper that uses mathematics and
computer science, instead of bankers, bookkeepers
and accountants.**
* It eliminates the middlemen, banks, govts, overdraft
fees, checking account fees, limited hours of service,
potential for censorship, frozen accounts, manipulation of the money supply, interest rates, the IMF,
the WEF, the BIS, brick-and-mortar buildings, ATMs,
checks, chargebacks, the petro dollar, the euro
dollar, bank seigniorage, the cantillon effect,
fractional reserve banking, visa, mastercard, amex,
western union, days of waiting for your wire transfer
to go through ...

>* **Instead of having someone between you and the
>person whose hand you want to shake, you can just
>shake their hand directly.**
>* **No need to ask permission to send your own
>money!**

## Put Simply…
* **Bitcoin is digital property that no one can take from
you.**
* >Owning bitcoin means owning the right to send value
from a specific address that you control with
your private key to ANY other address you choose.

*Bitcoin is a property right that is independent of
the monopoly on violence.*

~ Robert Breedlove @breedlove22

---

* **Bitcoin is a once-in-a-species event.**
* Bitcoin is choice.
* Bitcoin **engenders sovereignty.**
>* **The discovery of Bitcoin 15 years ago, is to
human financial freedom and sovereignty, as the
discovery of fire was to human flourishing over
500,000 years ago, and the printing press was to
decentralizing access to human knowledge nearly
900 years ago.**

---
* **Bitcoin is a true store of value.**
* It stores your most precious resource, your time, in
such a way that you can access it again later.
>*Bitcoin is like a high bandwidth conduit of energy to your
future self ... you can work today and Bitcoin will deep
freeze your energy for later use.* 

~ Robert Breedlove

>*The root of money is time
And the root of time is value*

~ Guy Swann

---
* Bitcoin is a timechain, literally.
* Satoshi referred to the timechain many times in
his emails with the early devs.
* You can measure time in blocks, since one block
is mined every ~10 minutes.
>* **Our time is our most scarce and precious resource.**
>* **It is our literal life force.**
>* **True Money allows us to store our time.**

* It is the way we can acknowledge the time we ‘spent’.
* We **trade our time for money, which is simply a record
of our time and effort.**
* **Bitcoin makes it possible to preserve our time such
that we have ‘access’ to it later in life, when
we are no longer able to work as we once did.**
---
* Bitcoin is a **store of value.**
* Bitcoin is a **medium of exchange.**
* Bitcoin **will one day be a unit of account.**
* Bitcoin **will one day be *THE unit of account.***
---
* **Bitcoin is scarce**
* It has a hard cap of 21,000,000. 
* There will never be more.
* Code is law here.*

*While it is ‘technically’ possible to change the
code, Satoshi’s genius prevents that, since increasing
(inflating) the supply would only serve to decrease the
value of all bitcoin in circulation. This therefore
incentivizes everyone to implicitly agree to maintain
the 21,000,000 hard cap supply.

* Check out **timechaincalendar.com** by @TC to check
the current block height, the available supply, and
numerous other metrics with regard to the bitcoin
timechain.
---
* **Bitcoin is infinitely divisible, without debasing the
supply.**
* **One pizza is one pizza, regardless of how small the
slices are.**
* It is currently divisible to the eighth
decimal: 1.00000000
* There are 100,000,000 satoshis in 1 bitcoin.
* 1 satoshi = 0.00000001
* You can buy sats (satoshis) in any amount.
---
* **Bitcoin is the hardest, soundest money we have ever
known.**
* It is even sounder than gold, since gold is not easily
divisible or portable, has low velocity (moves slowly)
and is not easily verifiable
* **Bitcoin has the most superior monetary properties
of any asset ever known.**

* **Bitcoin is the antidote.**
* Attempting to ‘stabilize’ the economy with bailouts,
money printing, QE and interest rate manipulation is
like having it on artificial life support
* This ‘machine’ can only go on so long, before becoming more and more expensive to maintain, and less
and less sustainable, leading to a serious breakdown.
* **Bitcoin fixes this**
* **Bitcoin is better money**
---
* **Bitcoin is anti-fragile.**
* And it gets more so with every attempted attack,
with every government ban, with every piece of mainstream media FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt).
>* Bitcoin has never been hacked.*
* Though many have tried.

*Although you may have heard of hacks, it is
the exchanges that have been hacked, not
the bitcoin protocol.
* **Remember:**
* Not your keys, not your coins.
* **Always** withdraw your sats to your **own wallet.**
* **Best** to buy peer-to-peer.
---
* **Bitcoin is a combination of:**
* computer science      
* network protocols
* electrical systems
* game theory
* conviction
* mimetics
* thermodynamics
* network effects
* cryptography
* energy
* true scarcity
* economic incentives
* software engineering
* time value of money
* tech adoption curves
* emergent phenomena
* power of decentralization
* low time preference
* alignment of incentives
* monetary neutrality
* financial activism
* immutability

... all working together to create trust
in a trustless, decentralized environment,
to support a 

* neutral
* secure
* censorship-resistant
* permissionless
* global

digital money and monetary network.

* **Bitcoin is a deep rabbit hole,** causing you to
question most everything you thought you knew ;) 
* Bitcoin is self-contained.
* **Bitcoin simply is.**
>*Bitcoin is. And that is enough.*

* **Bitcoin is a symbiotic relationship** between:

**Humans**

and

**A perfect solution to transfer and store
time/value.**

* Humans need bitcoin, bitcoin needs humans.
---
* **Bitcoin is the solution to the Byzantine General’s
problem.**
* This was once thought to be an unsolvable problem in
computer science
* This problem arises in decentralized systems, where
it was thought impossible to prove that message sent
= message received, since the ‘man-in-the-middle’
could be a bad actor and falsify the message.
* In other words, it seemed impossible to form consensus amongst a network of distributed and independent computers.
* By using a timestamp along with a cryptographically secured distributed ledger, Satoshi solved this
problem.
* His solution is known as **Nakamoto’s consensus.**
---
* **Bitcoin is the solution to the double-spend problem.**
* This means that when you send bitcoin, the receiver
can be sure that you actually owned the bitcoin you
sent, and, that once you sent it to them you cannot
spend those coins again by sending them to someone
else (double-spending).
* Just like me giving you an orange. Once it leaves
my hands and is in your hands, I no longer have
the orange to give to someone else.
>*..double-spends are never accepted into the
transaction pool, so every node bears
witness to which transaction it saw first
by working to put it into a block.*

~ Satoshi Nakamoto 2010-12-09

---
* **Bitcoin is a bearer asset,** like cash or gold, held by
the bearer (owner) directly

>* **This means that, once sent (given), it goes directly
to the new bearer (owner), with no middleman
(bank) needed to process the transaction.**

---
* **Bitcoin is P2P (peer-to-peer).**
* Bitcoin is censorship-resistant
>*  **This means that no one has the power to hold up
or to prevent a transaction from going through to
the new bearer.**
* Bitcoin flows freely.

* There can be no gatekeepers.
---
* **Bitcoin is trustless.**
>*The root problem with conventional
currency is all the trust that’s required
to make it work. The central bank must be
trusted not to debase the currency, but
the history of fiat currencies is full of
breaches of that trust.*

~ Satoshi Nakamoto on the importance of
Bitcoin’s trustless nature.

* **Bitcoin is code.**
* **Code is speech.**
* Check out github.com/bitcoin
* **This is currently the main bitcoin repository.**
* Click around to view the code, the pull requests,
the reviews, the commits, the bips (bitcoin
improvement proposals) and the developers who are
working on, maintaining and improving the
creation that is bitcoin.

* **Bitcoin is the internet of money.**
* When one stops to consider that everything else is
going/has gone digital, including:
 * music
 * books
 * banking
 * movies
 * education
 * photos
 * phone calls
 * radio
 * maps
 * games
 * meetings
 * and the list goes on (for better or for worse)

… then one sees how **it is really a logical step for
money to follow.**

> **BUT,** we need **BITCOIN, NOT CBDCs!**

## SATOSHI’s GENIUS
>* Bitcoin is **ALL** of the following:
> * A decentralized, distributed ledger
> * A payment system
> * And the value itself being transferred.

* Outside of bitcoin, **money creation** (issuance), and
**accounting** (keeping track of money received/spent),
**is centralized,** and includes the following separate
layers:

* Various Central Banks' issuance of money
* The ledgers of account, whether written or digital
* The trusted parties who enter the numbers into
the ledgers
* The trusted parties who keep the physical ledgers
safe, or who maintain the computer databases
* The trusted security teams who work to prevent
hacking of the databases

* With bitcoin, **all these layers are folded into one!**
* While this might sound more centralized, Satoshi’s
genius made it such that the opposite is true.
* It is **100% Decentralized!**

---

>* **Bitcoin has NO central point of failure.**

* The only way it could all be rolled into one, and be
decentralized, is that **the distributed ledger is
main-tained by a voluntary, world-wide, ad hoc
group of people voluntarily mining and/or running
full nodes.**
* And, the incentives of the network **encourage everyone to play by the rules**
* You can join us!
