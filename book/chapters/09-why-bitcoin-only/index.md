# WHY Bitcoin ONLY?
Of the over 2.5 million* (!) cryptocurrencies ever created,
and 13,000 currently trading, bitcoin is the only one that is:

* **TRULY decentralized**
* With a **TRULY distributed ledger**
* A **TRULY hard capped supply**
* A **TRULY immutable ledger**
* A **network effect** built over 15 years
* And a **monetary policy that cannot be manipulated!**
* Every other cryptocurrency has a **small, centralized
group who controls the supply, and/or has the
power to change the base layer protocol (monetary
policy).**
* **This is just like the central fiat banking system we
see today**
* Centralized power like this begs for manipulation and
corruption.
* See the altcoin pump/dump scam described on the
following page.

## ALTCOIN PUMP AND DUMPS
* Sadly, these are real, and happen daily with ‘cryptos/tokens’ other than bitcoin.
* There are various iterations, but one of the most
common types is the following:

* **Token Created:** A new crypto token gets made. Far
easier than it sounds, anyone can do it in minutes.
* **Website:** Often, a shiny, fancy website is created to
make the token look legit.
* **Paid Influencers:** Paid to promote it on social media,
Telegram etc.
* **Paid Insider Groups:** The info is sent to leaders of
some of the hundreds of ‘Trading’ or ‘Investment’
Groups, where people pay monthly or annual fees to
get ‘insider intel’.
* **Pre-Launch:** The paid influencers and paid group leaders buy first, at the bottom price.
* **Launch:** The token is ‘launched’ by these influencers
and group leaders, who tell their followers: ”Quick,
buy now!”
* **Pump:** The price pumps fast as their followers scramble to get in early.
* The rapidly rising price entices regular people to buy
in, in the hopes of making their fortune.

* This in turn has the effect of pumping the price
even further.
* **Dump:** This sad part usually happens fast. At a certain
point, the paid group leaders sell their tokens, ‘at the
top’. Then they tell their followers to sell.
* **Price Drop:** Because so many people sell at the
same time, and liquidity is generally low since it is
a new coin, the price drops fast.
* **Panic:** The price drop causes panic amidst the general
public, who have no idea of these back-door shenanigans, and they start to panic-sell.
* **Bag Holders:** The end of this sad story is that those
left ‘holding the bag’, will likely be holding their bags
forever.
* Without any real value or fundamentals, most of these
tokens and meme coins never recover a market
price.

## SECURITY & AVOIDING SCAMS
* **Stick with bitcoin only.**
* **Be super vigilant** about your cyber security!
* **Do your own research** and **secure your bitcoin** with
utmost care.

>* **NEVER give your seed words to anyone you
wouldn’t give the key to for your stash of gold!**

* **NEVER click on any links** in your email that ask you
to confirm account details of any kind. **Instead, go
to the official website directly** and check if you have
any notices requiring any actions.
* **BE AWARE** that there are endless imitations of
accounts with large followings on social media. If an
influencer randomly DMs you, it is probably a scam.
* **AVOID all the scams popping up on social media**
accounts, promising to double your bitcoin if you
send some to them! You will lose your bitcoin!
* **AVOID those same ‘double your crypto’ scams** on
You Tube.
* **BE CERTAIN** about the address you are sending your
bitcoin to, as transactions are irreversible. Ideally
check the whole address, especially if it is a large
amount.
