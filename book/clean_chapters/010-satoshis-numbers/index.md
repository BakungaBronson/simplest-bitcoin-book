# SATOSHI’S NUMBERS 369 CLOCK

**Bitcoin is designed to mine 6 blocks per hour >> one block
on average every ~10 minutes.**

* 24 hours in a day

2+4=**6**

* That works out to 144 blocks per day

1+4+4=**9**

* 52560 blocks per year

5+2+5+6+0=18

1+8=**9**

* 52704 blocks per leap year

5+2+7+0+4=18

1+8=**9**

* 21 Million coins:

2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = **3**

* 33 Halvings:

3 + 3 =**6**

* Difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks:

2 + 0 + 1 + 6 = **9**

~ Based on a tweet by @level39 

* The block reward halving happens every
210,000th block (approximately every four years)
2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = **3**

>*“If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6 and 9, then
you would have the key to the universe.”
~ Nikola Tesla*

## BLOCK REWARD = % OF SUPPLY

* The block subsidy (number of bitcoins rewarded
for each newly mined block) represents **the
percentage of the total supply** that will be mined
during that epoch

* For example, the current block reward between
2024-2028 is **3.125** bitcoin.

* In these same four years, **3.125**% of the 21
million bitcoins will be mined.

## REWARD EPOCHS

* Every four years, the bitcoin subsidy gets halved for each
block mined. **A Reward Epoch is that four year period.**

* **Reward epoch 1:** 2009-2012 **Block subsidy:** 50 bitcoin
= (50 bitcoins * 210,000 blocks) = 10,500,000 bitcoin

1+0+5+0+0+0+0+0 = **6**

* **Reward epoch 2:** 2012-2016 **Block subsidy:** 25 bitcoin
= (25 * 210,000) = 5,250,000 bitcoin

5+2+5+0+0+0+0 = 12

1+2 = **3**

* **Reward epoch 3:** 2016-2020 **Block subsidy:** 12.5 bitcoin
= (12.5 * 210,000) = 2,625,000 bitcoin

2+6+2+5+0+0+0 = 15

1+5 = **6**

* **Reward epoch 4:** 2020-2024 **Block subsidy:** 6.25 bitcoin
= (6.25 * 210,000) = 1,312,500 bitcoin

1+3+1+2+5+0+0 = 12

1+2 = **3**

* **Reward epoch 5:** 2024-2028 **Block subsidy:** 3.125 bitcoin
= (3.125 * 210,000) = 656,250 bitcoin

6+5+6+2+5+0 = 24

2+4 = **6**

* **Reward epoch 7: 2032-2036 Block subsidy:** 0.78125 btc
= (0.78125*210,000) = 164,062.5 bitcoin

1+6+4+0+6+2+5 = 24

2+4 = **6**

**... and so on until 2140**

## SATOSHI’S BIRTHDAY

* ***April 5, 1975*** is the date Satoshi claimed as his
birthday.
* While we cannot know if this was indeed his true birth
date, it is very interesting.
* ***April 5th*** (1933) was the day that Executive Order 6102
was signed by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt
“forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion,
and gold certificates within the continental United
States.”
* ***1975*** was the year the repeal of EO 6102 went into
effect, and US citizens were once again allowed to
hold more than 5oz of gold.

## A NUMERIC PALINDROME 6102-2016

* ***6102*** was the number of the above-mentioned
Executive Order.
* ***2016*** is the number of blocks mined during each difficulty adjustment (approximately 2 weeks).

>* In both of the above examples, one could
postulate that Satoshi was using numbers
to indicate a reversal, **an unwinding of the
damage inflicted by government overreach.**

## BITCOIN PIZZA DAY

* May 22 is known as Bitcoin Pizza Day. This was the
day that a guy, named Laszlo Hanyecz, announced
on bitcointalkforum.org that he had successfully
traded 10,000 bitcoin for pizza! Back then that
was about $40.
* In today’s prices, that would be ~$610,000,000. 
* It was a milestone for bitcoin, in that it was the first
known incident of someone trading bitcoin for a
good or service. What a long way we have come!
