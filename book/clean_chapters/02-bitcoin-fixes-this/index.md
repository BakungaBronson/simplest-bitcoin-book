# FIXES THIS FINANCIAL INCLUSIVITY
* **With bitcoin, everyone has access to the *same*
financial system, with the *same* rules for everyone.**
* No loopholes or back doors or special deals
for anyone.
* Everyone has the potential to be compensated for the
value they provide with the same real money,
created and maintained with the same rules.
* **Bitcoin is accessible to anyone, anywhere with
an internet connection.**

## ADDING VALUE TO THE WORLD
* **Bitcoin incentivizes people to add real value to the
community and the marketplace,** as this is the only
way to make more money
* If one is satisfied with less, one still benefits by working for a fair wage, and **when one saves, those savings maintain their value over time.**

## FIXES THIS ENVIRONMENT
* Sound money with a hard-capped supply creates a
very different dynamic to the one created by the
debt-based, unlimited money-printing which we
see taking place today.
* Instead of an unstoppable drive to consume ever
more, in a race to the bottom to pay
compounding interest rates on loans and debt
that will ultimately never get paid off, **bitcoin
provides an off-ramp to a world where a low-time
preference is sought after.**
>* Rampant environmental destruction is **replaced
with less consumption, less waste, and a
considered approach to production,** where the
market decides what holds true value, and
things are therefore built to last.
* This is a net benefit to people, plants and animals!

##  FIXES THIS WAR
* The unlimited printing of the fiat monetary
system is what makes ‘forever-wars’ possible and
profitable. 
* Since the people are mostly in the dark about how
war spending works, or where the money for war
comes from, there is little to no accountability on
the part of government. Wars can drag on for
years in remote places, with no real oversight.
* Starting with Vietnam, wars have become ‘credit
card wars’ (h/t @AlexGladstein), since the
government borrows money to fund the wars, and
then borrows more money to pay the interest on
the initial loans... rinse and repeat.
>* **On a bitcoin standard, it would require the
people of a country to be willing to help pay for
a war. They would likely only do so if it was
absolutely and clearly necessary, to defend their
families and country, with an end-goal in site.**
* Since there would be no undue profits to be made,
government officials and corporations would not be
incentivized to promote or engage in war as a
viable option.
* **Efforts would greatly increase to find ways to
come to peaceful, low-cost resolutions instead.**

##  FIXES THIS TIME PREFERENCE

**High Time Preference:** Instant gratification, Impatience,
Short-term planning
**Low Time Preference:** Delayed gratification, Patience,
Long-term planning

* High-time preference leads to personal, societal and
environmental destruction. When our money is
losing value each day, we are ‘forced’ to be
impatient and to spend it as quickly as possible,
before it loses more value. 
* When our time is devalued by an ever-inflating fiat
currency, we lose connection to the value of our
time.
* This leads to disconnection, and an undercurrent
of stress.
* Attempts to alleviate the stress, and find meaning,
are distorted and become distractions such as
over-consumption of drugs, alcohol, shopping,
porn, fast food, short attention spans, addiction
to screens/social media, impulsive decisions etc.
* **Sound money on the other hand, which holds its
value over time and properly measures our
contributions through our work, leads to a lowtime preference, thoughtful quality of life, with
meaningful relationships, less consumption, deeper
connection, more profound conversation, long-term
goals and increased creativity.**
