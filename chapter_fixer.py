You are an expert Markdown editor. Your task is to merge two versions of a document chapter.

**Context:**
- **ORIGINAL Version**: This version has the correct and precise Markdown syntax, formatting (like blockquotes and newlines), and all necessary image tags (e.g., `![alt text](image.png)`).
- **CHANGED Version**: This version contains legitimate text edits and rephrasing from a human editor. However, it was processed through a tool like Google Docs, so its Markdown formatting may be broken, and ALL image tags have been lost.

**Your Goal:**
Produce a single "FIXED" version that combines the best of both files. You must follow these rules precisely:
1. **Preserve Text Edits**: You MUST keep all sentence-level edits, rephrasing, and corrections from the CHANGED version.
2. **Restore Markdown Syntax**: You MUST use the markdown structure (headings, exact blockquote formatting, newlines, lists, bold/italic markers) from the ORIGINAL version as the source of truth.
3. **Restore Image Tags**: You MUST re-insert all image tags (e.g., `![alt text](image.png)`) from the ORIGINAL version into their correct locations within the newly edited text. The final output must contain all images from the original.

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT add any commentary, explanations, or introductory text. Only output the raw, fixed Markdown content for the chapter.

**ORIGINAL Version (Correct Syntax and Images):**
```markdown
{original_chapter}
```
---
**CHANGED Version (User Edits, Broken Syntax, No Images):**
```markdown
