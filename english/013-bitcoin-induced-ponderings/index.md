## A RABBIT HOLE PONDERING

Bitcoin is really a rather fascinating ‘thing’

Except it is not a ‘thing’

In the sense that you cannot touch it

Yet it is touching millions of us

Around the world

Soon to be billions..

It is true that

It is digital bits and bytes

Algorithms and code

0’s and 1’s

And that if every single node

Archival node, pruned node and light node

Were somehow

Destroyed

It would no longer exist

In the way we know it

Are able to perceive it..

It would, however, still ‘exist’

In the sense that quantum physics

Or gravity

Exists

Regardless of human perception..

In the sense that mathematics existed

Before humans codified it

Chose symbols to represent it..

Truth

Does not need us

## WHY WILL ALL VALUE ACCRUE TO BITCOIN

There are some interesting game theories that appear
to converge when it comes to bitcoin, making the
likelihood of it’s growth and increased value over time
more and more certain.

## SCHELLING POINT

* Introduced in the 1960s by the American economist,
Thomas Schelling, the Schelling point basically asserts
that **people who cannot necessarily communicate
with one another, can still converge on a decision
or course of action, especially when a compelling
solution to a problem presents itself** (-> bitcoin)
* In addition, as more people are drawn to the Schelling
point, it attracts ever more people (-> bitcoin)

## LINDY EFFECT
* In essence, the Lindy Effect states **that the longer an
idea, a technology or a business has been around,
the longer it is likely to endure.**

## METCALFE’S LAW

* Popularized by Robert Metcalfe, who invented
Ethernet, among other things. Metcalfe’s law states
that **a network becomes proportionally more valuable the more users it has.** Utility increases exponentially as more and more users join, strengthening
the network.

## THE P2P NETWORK
>*It is a global distributed database, with
additions to the database by consent of
the majority...*

Global reachable Bitcoin Nodes distribution, June 2024

>*The result is a distributed system with
no single point of failure. Users hold
the crypto keys to their own money and
transact directly with each other, with
the help of the P2P network to check for
double-spending.*

## BITCOIN, NONVIOLENT COMMUNICATION & PERMACULTURE

I see **Bitcoin,** brought to us by Satoshi Nakamoto, as being
the foundation layer for a healthy society with regards to:

* **communicating value**
* **transacting and exchanging**
* **storing our time/life energy**
in an emergent, organic, honest unfolding.

I see **Nonviolent Communication,** brought to us by Marshall
Rosenberg PhD, as the foundation layer for a healthy society
with regards to:

* **communicating feelings and needs**
* **deep listening, empathy**
* **finding co-creative solutions**
in an emergent, organic, honest unfolding.

I see **Natural Farming and Permaculture,** brought to us by
our Ancestors, and more recently, Masunobu Fukuoka and Bill
Mollison as being the foundation layer for a healthy society
with regards to:

* **communication with the earth**
* **growing food, healing the soil**
* **tending the wild**
in an emergent, organic and honest unfolding

Each of these technologies, one mathematical, taking
us beyond mathematics, one linguistic, taking us beyond
language, one biological, taking us beyond biology, are
based in Truth.

It is up to us to make use of them, to live into them, and
to allow them to guide us deeper and deeper into the
profound potential we feel tingling at the tip of
our perception.

**May we find the courage, the strength,
the wisdom and the grace
to move forth fearlessly
on the journey**
