* The fiat money system is broken (always has been).
* It is not sustainable (never has been).
* There is no way to fix it (never will be).

---
## THE (NOT) GOLD STANDARD
* Many people still believe that money is backed by
gold.
* It is not.
* It has not been backed by gold since 1971, when
President Nixon unilaterally took the world off the
gold standard (the Nixon Shock).
* See **wtfhappenedin1971.com** to get a clear picture
of the damage this did.

>**FIAT:** (noun) /ˈfiː.æt/
>
>: an authoritative or arbitrary order : DECREE
>
>: an authoritative determination : DICTATE
>
>**: a command or act of will that creates something without
>or as if without further effort**

~ merriam-webster.com/dictionary

>**FIAT :** from Latin fieri «to be made, come into being»

* Fiat is money that has value only because the government says (decrees) that it does.
* Therefore people (have to) believe it does.
>* **Even if they don’t believe fiat has value, by law they
are forced to use it and to accept it as payment for
goods and services.**
* **Fiat money is printed/created out of thin air.**
* These days about 5% of all dollars are printed as
cash.
* The other 95% is digitally created by banks entering
numbers into a computer when they issue loans

>*It costs only a few cents for the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing to produce a $100 bill…*

>***Pelley:*** *Where does it come from?

>***Powell:*** *We print it digitally. So as a central bank, we

>distribute that through the Federal Reserve banks.*

~ CNBC ’60 Minutes’ Interview, May 17, 2020
Two months after the onset of the C*vid-19 lockdown

>There’s really no limit to what we can do
with these lending programs that we have. 

~ Fed Chair Jerome Powell
March 18, 2020 on CBS News

>Yes, there is an infinite amount of cash in the Federal
Reserve. We will do whatever we need to do to make
sure there’s enough cash in the banking system. 

~ Neel Kashkari , President of the Minneapolis Fed
March 23, 2020, CBS '60 Minutes'

>The ‘we’ here is five people voting on changes t
monetary policy within the Federal Reserve system
during FOMC meetings. 5 out of 330,000,000.
That’s all it takes to change US monetary policy.

## FROM THE HORSE’S MOUTH OF OLDE

>*The bank hath benefit of interest on all monies
that it creates out of nothing.*

*~ William Paterson, 1694
Founder of the Bank of England*

>*All of the perplexities, confusion, and distress in America arises,
not from the defects of the Constitution or Confederation,
not from the want of honor or virtue,
so much as from downright ignorance of
the nature of coin, credit, and circulation.*

*~ John Adams
2nd President of the United States, 1797-1801*

>*I believe that banking institutions are more
dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.
Already they have raised up a money aristocracy
that has set the government at defiance.
The issuing power should be taken from the banks, and
restored to the people to whom it properly belongs.*

*~ Thomas Jefferson
3rd President of the United States, 1801-1809*

>*While boasting of our noble deeds were careful to conceal the ugly
fact that by an iniquitous money system we have nationalized a
system of oppression which, though more refined, is not
less cruel than the old system of chattel slavery.*

~Horace Greeley
US Congressman 1848-49
Founder of The New York Tribune

---

>*Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is
absolute master of all industry and commerce…
when you realize that the entire system is very easily controlled, one
way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have
to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate*

~ James A. Garfield
20th President of the United States, Mar-Sept.1881
Assassinated in 1881

>*There today exists uncontrolled in the hands of a set of men
a power to make dollars from nothing.*

~ Thomas W. Lawson, Author 'Frenzied Finance', 1905

>*I was as secretive - indeed, as furtive - as any conspirator.
Discovery, we knew, simply must not happen, or else all our time
and effort would be wasted. If it were to be exposed that our
particular group had got together and written a banking bill, that
bill would have no chance whatever of passage by Congress.*

~ Frank A.Vanderlip
President of the National City Bank of New York
(forerunner of Citi Bank)
~ Writing in 1935 of the secretive meeting that took place on
Jekyll Island in 1910, to draft the bill that was passed as
the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.

>*This (Federal Reserve) Act establishes the most gigantic trust on
earth. When the President (Woodrow Wilson) signs the Bill, the
invisible government of the Monetary Power will be legalised…
The worst legislative crime of the ages is perpetrated
by this banking and currency Bill.*

~ Charles A. Lindbergh, Sr.
US Congressman 1907-1917 

---

>*I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country.
A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit.
Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation,
therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men.
We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most
completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized
world. No longer a government by free opinion, no longer a
government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a
government by the opinion and duress of
a small group of dominant men.*

~ Woodrow Wilson
28th President of the United States, 1913-1921
6 years after passing the Federal Reserve Act of 1913.

>*The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know,
that a financial element in the large centers
has owned the government of the U.S. since
the days of Andrew Jackson.*

~ Franklin D. Roosevelt
32nd President of the United States in a letter written
on Nov. 21, 1933 to Colonel E. Mandell House

>*It [the depression] was not accidental.
It was a carefully contrived occurrence….
The international bankers sought to bring about
a condition of despair here so that they might
emerge as the rulers of us all.*

~ Congressman Louis T. McFadden,
Assassinated in 1936

>Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee
*Each and every time a bank makes a loan,
new bank credit is created - new deposits - brand new money.*

~ Graham F.Towers
Gov of the Central Bank of Canada, 1934-55

---

>*If there were no debts in our money system,
there wouldn’t be any money*

*~ Marriner Eccles,
1941, Gov. of the Fed*

>*I have never yet had anyone who could, through the
use of logic and reason, justify the Federal government
borrowing the use of its own money…
I believe the time will come when people will
demand that this be changed.
I believe the time will come in this country when
they will actually blame you and me and
everyone else connected with the Congress
for sitting idly by and permitting
such an idiotic system to continue.*

~ Wright Patman
US Congressman 1928-1976
Chairman, Committee on Banking and Currency 1963-1975

>*When you or I write a check, there must be sufficient funds in our
account to cover the check, but when the Federal Reserve writes a
check there is no bank deposit on which that check is drawn. When
the Federal Reserve writes a check, it is creating money*

~ Federal Reserve Bank of Boston
'Putting It Simply', 1984

## THE FEDERAL RESERVE

* The Fed is the ‘independent’ central bank of the
US. It was created in 1913 with the passing of the
Federal Reserve Act.
* It has a unique structure, part private and part
government.
* It is supposed to be a politically independent,
non-partisan entity within the government.
* While the Fed Board of Governors is appointed by the
President and confirmed by Congress, **the
decisions of the Fed do not need to be ratified
by anyone.** 

**It consists of:**

* The Federal Reserve Board of Governors
* 12 Federal Reserve Banks
* The Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC),
which is the monetary policy-making body.

**The Fed is responsible for:**

* Overseeing US monetary policy, promoting employment and stable prices.
* Regulating and supervising banking and financial
institutions.
* Providing payments services to financial institutions.
* Promoting consumer protection and community
development.

---

## A NOTE ON THE FED CHAI TE ON THE FED CHAIR

* **The Chair of the Federal Reserve is also:**

* Chairs the Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC), which decides on the direction of US
monetary policy (for eg: QE, interest rate hikes)
* A member of the International Monetary Fund,
the IMF
* A member of the Bank for International
Settlements, the BIS (the bank of central banks).
* The US finance minister of the G-7
* The US finance minister of the G-20

* A **whole** lot of power for one person.

---

## FRACTIONAL RESERVE BANKING, INTEREST & LOANS

* **Fractional Reserve banking:** Until March 2020, banks
were required to hold a reserve of 10%, and could
loan out 90%.
* **Since March 2020, there is no reserve required, allowing banks to issue unlimited loans.**

* A loan is debt-based money, and you are required to
pay interest on the loan.

>* **Fun Fact 1:** The money to pay the interest on the
>loan is NOT created by the banks.
>* **Fun Fact 2:** It is NEVER created.
>* **Fun Fact 3:** There is NOT ENOUGH money in the
>world to pay back all the loans + the interest due
>on those loans.
>* **Fun Fact 4:** There never will be!

---

## A NOTE ON THE PETRO DOLLA
* One could say **that until 1971 the dollar was backed
by gold, and since 1974 it has been backed by oil,
and thus by default, the US Military.**
* **In 1974 the US and Saudi Arabia entered into bilateral agreements to price the sale of oil in US dollars.**
* Since then, most global oil sales have been settled in
US dollars.
* This has contributed greatly to the dollar becoming
the strongest currency in the world.
* **It has thus been artificially propped up,** even during
times when it would normally have struggled.
* Since late in 2022, a number of countries have
begun to trade in currencies other than the US
dollar
* It is very possible that this could be the beginning of
the end of the petro dollar. What happens next
remains to be seen…

---

## ON QE (QUANTITATIVE EASING)
* **Quantitative Easing is considered an ‘unconventional
monetary policy’ used by Central Banks to ‘stimulate
the economy’, whereby the Fed buys government
bonds and other government securities.**
* It was first used by Japan between 2001-2006.
Following that, the US, UK, and the Eurozone used
QE during the 2008 financial crisis
* Since then, the only time the US has not had a QE
program was between 2014-2019.
* As seen below, critics contend that **QE
overwhelmingly benefits the already-wealthy**

![QE was socialism for the 1%](figure-01-QE.png)

---

## CYCLES

* **In all of nature, there are cycles, natural ebbs and
flows, expansions and contractions.**

* This **contributes to an overall, over-time, balance
and sustainability** of the whole interconnected
system, of all life on earth.
* **The debt-based, fiat currency system ignores the
wisdom of natural cycles,** and instead is based on,
and 100% reliant for its survival upon, unparalleled
and unmitigated growth, in order to continue
servicing its debts.
* In nature, this is cancer.
* In ‘the economy’, this unnatural trajectory is further
supported by the government bailing out failing
banks and large companies, rather than allowing them
to fold, and be recycled into something new, something healthier.
* **The short-sightedness of bailing out failing companies is putting the whole economy at risk.** In essence,
it is just kicking the can down the road, and the inevitable turmoil that lies ahead is likely to be far, far
more intense than if natural cycles were allowed to
play out
* **We are indebted to Satoshi Nakamoto, and to the
cypherpunks before and after him,** for having the
vision, foresight, determination and skill to provide
a lifeboat to carry us to new shores.

---

* Once we realize the gift that this is, it is up to us to
jump on board, with full hearts and clear minds, to
take the trip and build a new world with the Money
of Peace.
>* **Bitcoin fixes the money, it is up to us to fix the rest.
And, to be clear, by having the money fixed, a LOT
of other things will be fixed, by default** 

* The main one being that large-scale, government-initiated, kinetic war will no longer be profitable, or possible, without the support of the people.
* Additionally, there will naturally be less consumption,
along with a switch over to real-value goods and services, free markets, real savings, & demonetization of
housing and real estate, that was never meant to
be monetized in the first place.

## WE NEED BECAUSE INFLATION IS THEFT

![2024 FRED chart showing the declining purchasing power of the
dollar](figure-02-consumer%20price.png)

2024 FRED chart showing the declining purchasing power of the
dollar since the formation of the Federal Reserve in
1913. The cumulative rate of inflation since 1913 is around
3.067%. All central bank fiat currencies around the world
are following a similar rate of decline.

* **The more money that is created out of thin air,
the more all money loses value/purchasing power.**
* This is called **inflation.**
* Inflation is **time-theft,** literally. The value of your
time is stolen when you save it in a currency that is
inflated, debased and manipulated.
* Inflation is also a **hidden tax**.

---

* This time-theft and tax has affected all other
countries’ fiat currencies as well, since they have all
been pegged to the US dollar, as it has been the
world reserve currency since the Bretton Woods
agreement in 1944.
* **In the USA, a 2% annual inflation rate is written into
the Federal Reserve mandate.**
* This means that **you are GUARANTEED to be able
to buy 2% LESS** with the same $20 bill each year.
* **In March 2024, the annual inflation rate was 3.5%,**
(a lot more than 2%, which means you lost 3.5% of
your purchasing power between March 2023 and
March 2024.
* Put another way, this means that on average, things
went up in price by 3.5%
* **If inflation was measured accurately, like it was
done until the early 1980’s, it would actually
be closer to 10% in 2024.**
* When looked at by category, one sees that
inflation is a whole lot worse than 3.5% in many
categories over the past year.
* When one looks at one's rent, grocery bills, gas
prices, almost anything one buys, it is quite clear that
inflation is rampant in every sector

**Average Inflation over the
past 50 years in the US:**

|  Average Cost   |   1971  |   2021  |   % Increase  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Salary   |    $9,400 |    $59,400 |    532% |
|   House  |    $23,400 |    $513,000 |    2,092% |
|    Gallon of Gas | $0.36    |   $4.17 |  1,058%   |
|    New Car |  $3,400   |   $47,000  |    1,282% |
|   College Degree   |  $1,400   |   $26,000  |  1,757%   |
|   Basket Groceries  |$20     |  $210  |    950% |
|  Electricity/kWh   |  $0.02    |   $0.15  |   650%  |

>**True Story:**
~ A house was bought in 1976 for $58,000.
~ When accounting for ‘official’ inflation, this would be
$279,000 in 2022 dollars.
~ In 2022 the same house was valued at $2.09 million.
~ Ponder on that…

>*Fiat currency is disinformation.
What information does a $10 bill convey?
The 10 is a numerator of a fraction with
the denominator missing.
10 out of what?
The 10 says nothing without a known
and stable denominator.*

~ @bitlany

---

* **As inflation increases, your savings (if you are lucky
enough to have savings), lose value.**
* Over time, they lose **A LOT** of value
>*If you started saving $100/month today, with the
>best available interest rate of 0.05%:
> * n 30 years you would have saved **$84,019.**
>* When adjusted for the FED’s mandated 2% inflation
>* In 30 years your savings would have an effective
purchasing power of just **$46,384.**
>* Adjusting for today’s inflation of 3.5%:
>* Your $84,019 worth of savings would have the
purchasing power of just **$11,037** in 30 years!

* **In effect this means that approximately six out of
seven hours of your work have been stolen = *Time
Theft.***

---
**Another way to look at it is the following:**
* In **1971**, the cost of a house = **2.5** times an average
annual salary.
* In **2024,** the cost of a house = **8.6** times an
average annual salary.
* In **1971**, a new car cost about **1/3** of an average salary
* In **2024**, a new car cost over **3/4** of an average salary.

I trust that it is now clear that
inflation
does  * **not** *
work in your favor.

**Note:** All of these numbers are averages, and variable based
on many factors. The point remains, inflation is a hidden tax
and is time-theft on our real labor and production

>* **Hard money fixes this.**
>* **Bitcoin is hard money**

## WE NEEDTO REPLACE THE CENTRALLYCONTROLLED, MANIPULATED, DEBTBASED ECONOMY

>*I don’t believe we shall ever have a good money again,
before we take the thing out of the hands of government,
that is, we can’t take them violently out of the hands of
government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way
introduce something they can’t stop.*

~ Friedrich Hayek, 1984
Austrian Economist, Philosopher and Author, 1899-1992

---
* **45% of all the US dollars in existence were
printed between April 2020-Jan 2022!**
* Printed out of thin air that is, remember?
* Fiat money is centrally controlled by the state, and
the supply is easily manipulated.
* **It took 205 years for the US National Debt to
reach $1 trillion. (1776 > 1981)**
* It took just **33 more years for the** US National Debt
to reach **$34 trillion!** (1981 > 2024)

>*Global debt, measured by the Institute of
International Finance, now totals $303 TRILLION.
This is our planet on debt-based fiat.
By the way, global GDP is only $84 trillion.*

*~ Nik Bhatia, Author of ‘Layered Money’, 2021*

* **For reference**

| **If you have:** | **You can spend $1/second** |                |

| **$1 Trillion**  | for 11,680,000 days     | = 32000years |

* We are all at the mercy of those who have the power
to decide when to print more, and what interest rates
to charge.
* **If the Fed raises the interest rates, then getting a
loan for a house or a car becomes suddenly more
expensive, which slows down spending, leading to
stagflation**

* **If they keep the rates artificially low, we enter a
period of depression**

>* **Allowing the central bank to create the financia
‘weather’, takes away our freedom to let the market decide what is of value, and what is not.**

* In addition, **when they bail out banks and corporations, they artificially prop up the economy.** It is only
a matter of time before the house of cards falls.
*  The original argument for having a central bank was
that there needed to be a Lender of Last Resort when
the economy wobbled.

---
* **This has turned into the central bank being a Ruler of
First Resort, with unparalleled, unelected, ultimately
authoritarian power.**

> *All money is political, except for Bitcoin.
Fiat currencies, banking instruments, fintech credits,
other cryptocurrencies, and even gold are all controlled
by governments, corporations, or small groups.
Having an exception will prove very useful
as we head into the future.*

*~ Alex Gladstein @gladstein
Chief Strategy Officer for the Human Rights Foundation*

>*Bitcoin links together 8 billion people, links together a
hundred million companies, it synchronizes the world
across political jurisdictions, and it returns rationality to
the entire financial system, and it returns freedom and
property rights to the entire human race*

*~Michael Saylor
CEO Microstrategy*

## WE NEED TO BANK THE UNBANKED

>*For 953 million people in 20 countries with weakening
currencies, Bitcoin represents something greater than a
treasury asset. For them, it’s more like an ark of
encrypted energy to escape the flood.*

*~ Michael Saylor
CEO of Microstrategy*

* **As of 2024, approximately 25% of the adults in
the world are unbanked, about 1.4 billion people!**

>* **This means they have no access to banking services
>and cannot use ATM’s, debit cards, credit cards or
>checks.**
>* **In addition, they are not able to get loans to start
a business, to buy a car or a house etc.**

* **Sending and receiving money, or cashing checks, is
expensive.**

* They have to use money-transfer and check cashing
services like Western Union, that charge high rates
and take time to process.

* It is **especially expensive for people sending money
home to their families** in other countries (remittances),
which can cost up to 10%, or 12% via a bank

---
* It is **expensive and time-consuming for those receiving remittances,** as they need to pay for transport and
go to the money-transfer office, often far from where
they live, to get the money their family member sent.

* Oftentimes it is not safe for them to travel to these
offices.
* Bitcoin, over the Lightning Network, provides an
instant solution to these problems now!

***#bitcoin fixes this***

people ever been stopped?*

## WE NEED TO HELP PEOPLE ESCAPE TYRANNY AND CURRENCY COLLAPSE

* As we have seen, over the past couple of years,
governments can and do freeze the bank
accounts of those they disagree with.

>* **This shows that, in essence, your money in the bank
is nothing more than an IOU that can be stolen
from you at any time.**

* In addition, when inflation runs rampant, as we are
currently seeing in 2024 in Venezuela (283%), Sudan
(63%), Lebanon (212%), Syria (79%),
Argentina (161%), Zimbabwe (47%), Turkey
(64%) and more, people’s life-savings are
vaporized, sometimes overnight, and there is
nothing they can do about it.
* For people experiencing any of the above, **bitcoin
becomes a real, immediate solution to
an otherwise untenable problem.**
* **Considering that both tyranny and inflation is
on the rise in many places, one would be wise
to hedge against them by acquiring bitcoin now.**
---
## WE NEED TO AVOID CBDCS
* You may have heard that **central banks are starting
to create CBDC’s, Central Bank Digital Currencies.**
In May 2020, 35 countries were exploring this option.
* In March 2022, 87 countries were actively looking
at, or had already launched, a pilot CBDC
* As of this writing in June 2024, 134 countries
representing 98% of global GDP are in the
research, development, pilot or launch stage.
www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/

>**CBDCs are very similar to the electronic money
you see in your online bank account, except that
by being natively digital, they are programmable
and 100% controllable.**

>*A key difference with CBDCs is
central banks would have **absolute control..***

~Agustin Carstens
General Mgr, BIS - Bank for International
Settlements (The bank of all banks)

* **This means the government can program an expiration date on your money,** forcing you to spend it
before it expires.

---

* **They can also program other things into it,** like only
allowing it to be spent at certain shops, websites or
jurisdictions, and not at others.
* **They could link it to:** your credit score, your health
pass, digital ID and other social scores.

* **They can program any restrictions they see fit,** based
on your specific score in one area, or on your
‘overall score’, or on what they deem the
‘economy’ needs.
* In addition, they will be able to surveil every single
thing you do with your money.

>*We don’t know who’s using a $100 bill today and we
don’t know who’s using a 1,000 peso bill today.
The key difference with the CBDC is **the central bank
will have absolute control on the rules and regulations
that will determine the use** of **that expression of
central bank liability,** and also **we will have
the technology to enforce that.***

~Agustin Carstens
GM, BIS - Bank for International Settlements

>* **Note:** Saying **“that expression of central bank liability”** implies that your value, your life force, stored
as money, is actually ‘owned’ by the central bank.

## WE NEED TO SAVE THE GARDEN

* **Bitcoin plucks out, at the root, THE biggest issue we
face, the Fiat Lie.**

* This is the lie of corrupted fiat currency, usury and all
that comes with it to steal your time, while greatly
enriching those closest to the money printer.

* The **Fiat Lie** is like a giant **monster weed** in your garden, **sucking** all the nutrients from the soil, **killing**
all the mycelium, and **blocking** the sunlight so that
the other plants cannot thrive, and are struggling to
survive.
* Suddenly when this noxious, monster Fiat Lie weed
is gone, Truth enters!

>* All the plants **(the people)** can begin to recover.
>* The soil **(being peoples’ creativity, real goods and
>services)** can regenerate.
>* The mycelium **(being authentic connection between
>people)** will regrow.
>* And the sunlight **(unmediated life force)** will shine
>down once again upon us all!
---

## WE NEED TO FIX THE WORLD
* This is not a joke. **#bitcoinfixesthis** is a running meme
for good reason.
* While this might sound somewhat ‘grandiose’, let me
explain. When one considers the ‘way things are’,
**one can see that ‘something is very wrong’.**
* Rampant destruction, environmental degradation,
splintered families and communities, loss of cultures, languages, traditions, poverty increasing, massive wealth concentrating in the hands of the (very)
few, over-consumption, infinite money backing
politicians, lack of food and clean water for millions,
ever-increasing obesity and auto-immune disorders,
seemingly endless wars …

# Chapter 2

# FIXES THIS FINANCIAL INCLUSIVITY
* **With bitcoin, everyone has access to the *same*
financial system, with the *same* rules for everyone.**
* No loopholes or back doors or special deals
for anyone.
* Everyone has the potential to be compensated for the
value they provide with the same real money,
created and maintained with the same rules.
* **Bitcoin is accessible to anyone, anywhere with
an internet connection.**

## ADDING VALUE TO THE WORLD
* **Bitcoin incentivizes people to add real value to the
community and the marketplace,** as this is the only
way to make more money
* If one is satisfied with less, one still benefits by working for a fair wage, and **when one saves, those savings maintain their value over time.**

---
## FIXES THIS ENVIRONMENT
* Sound money with a hard-capped supply creates a
very different dynamic to the one created by the
debt-based, unlimited money-printing which we
see taking place today.
* Instead of an unstoppable drive to consume ever
more, in a race to the bottom to pay
compounding interest rates on loans and debt
that will ultimately never get paid off, **bitcoin
provides an off-ramp to a world where a low-time
preference is sought after.**
>* Rampant environmental destruction is **replaced
with less consumption, less waste, and a
considered approach to production,** where the
market decides what holds true value, and
things are therefore built to last.
* This is a net benefit to people, plants and animals!
---
##  FIXES THIS WAR
* The unlimited printing of the fiat monetary
system is what makes ‘forever-wars’ possible and
profitable. 
* Since the people are mostly in the dark about how
war spending works, or where the money for war
comes from, there is little to no accountability on
the part of government. Wars can drag on for
years in remote places, with no real oversight.
* Starting with Vietnam, wars have become ‘credit
card wars’ (h/t @AlexGladstein), since the
government borrows money to fund the wars, and
then borrows more money to pay the interest on
the initial loans... rinse and repeat.
>* **On a bitcoin standard, it would require the
people of a country to be willing to help pay for
a war. They would likely only do so if it was
absolutely and clearly necessary, to defend their
families and country, with an end-goal in site.**
* Since there would be no undue profits to be made,
government officials and corporations would not be
incentivized to promote or engage in war as a
viable option.
* **Efforts would greatly increase to find ways to
come to peaceful, low-cost resolutions instead.**
---
##  FIXES THIS TIME PREFERENCE

**High Time Preference:** Instant gratification, Impatience,
Short-term planning
**Low Time Preference:** Delayed gratification, Patience,
Long-term planning

* High-time preference leads to personal, societal and
environmental destruction. When our money is
losing value each day, we are ‘forced’ to be
impatient and to spend it as quickly as possible,
before it loses more value. 
* When our time is devalued by an ever-inflating fiat
currency, we lose connection to the value of our
time.
* This leads to disconnection, and an undercurrent
of stress.
* Attempts to alleviate the stress, and find meaning,
are distorted and become distractions such as
over-consumption of drugs, alcohol, shopping,
porn, fast food, short attention spans, addiction
to screens/social media, impulsive decisions etc.
* **Sound money on the other hand, which holds its
value over time and properly measures our
contributions through our work, leads to a lowtime preference, thoughtful quality of life, with
meaningful relationships, less consumption, deeper
connection, more profound conversation, long-term
goals and increased creativity.**

# Chapter 3

# WHAT IS BITCOIN ?

>*“Writing a description for this thing
for general audiences is bloody hard.
There’s nothing to relate it to.”*

~ Satoshi Nakamoto 2010-07-05

>*Total circulation will be 21,000,000
coins. It’ll be distributed to network
nodes (miners) when they make blocks,
with the amount cut in half every 4 years.
first 4 years: 10,500,000 coins
next 4 years: 5,250,000 coins
next 4 years: 2,625,000 coins
next 4 years: 1,312,500 coins etc...
When that runs out, the system can support
transaction fees if needed. It’s based on
open market competition, and there will
probably always be nodes willing to
process transactions for free.*

~ Satoshi Nakamoto 2009-01-09

* **Bitcoin is freedom money…** in the sense that it has
the potential to free us all from the overarching
manipulation by, and control of, the central banking
system
* **In bitcoin, the monetary rules are the same for
EVERYONE, EVERYWHERE.**
* Bitcoin is inclusive, in the sense that anyone with an
internet connection can participate in the network,
and **has to play by the same rules.**

---
## bitcoin is:
* **DECENTRALIZED**         
* **TRULY SCARCE**          
* **CENSORSHIP RESISTANT** 
* **A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER**
* **INCORRUPTIBLE**
* PERMISSIONLESS
* AUDITABLE
* TRANSPARENT
* IMMUTABLE
* BORDERLESS
* HARD TO COUNTERFEIT
* PSUEDONYMOUS
* FRICTIONLESS
* TRUSTLESS
* PEER-TO-PEER
---
* Bitcoin is decentralized.
* **It is run on thousands of nodes worldwide, by thousands of people who don’t know each other.**
* No one person, government or company can ever
control it.
* You can run a node too, it’s easy ;)
* By running your own node, you increase your
privacy and help to secure the network when you
verify your own transactions.
> **Don’t trust. Verify**
---
* **Bitcoin (upper case ‘B’)** is a monetary network.
* **bitcoin (lower case ‘b’)** is the currency, or monetary asset, that is issued on, and runs on the Bitcoin
network.

---
* **Bitcoin is the great incentivizer.**
>* **The genius of Satoshi was such that in bitcoin, for
the first time, both good and bad actors are incentivized to play by the rules.**

> *“The incentive may help encourage
nodes to stay honest.
If a greedy attacker is able to assemble
more CPU proof-of-worker than all the
honest nodes, he would have to choose
between using it to defraud people by
stealing back his payments,
or using it to generate new coins.
He ought to find it more profitable to play
by the rules, such rules that favour
him with more new coins than
everyone else combined,
than to undermine the system and
the validity of his own wealth.”*

~ Satoshi Nakamoto 2008-10-31

* **Bitcoin is the first digitally native money,** unlike
your online checking account, which is just a
digital form of central bank fiat.

* Consider the implications ...

>*Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables

>*Bitcoin is (almost) costless to move with certainty.
I know with 100% certainty what I am receiving.*

~ Michael Saylor CEO of Microstrategy

* You can send $1.13, or 46c or 359 sats or 500,000,000
sats or $1 million to anyone, anywhere, anytime
via the Bitcoin Network, or the Lightning Network
built on Bitcoin.
* **And no one can stop you.**
* Can you do that with gold, silver, USD/GBP/EUR/YEN/
CYK/ZAR or any other central bank fiat currency?

---
* **Bitcoin is historical.** This is the first time in history that
a truly decentralized, censorship-resistant, immutable,
borderless, permissionless, and incorruptible monetary system with an absolute hard cap (21 million
coins) has ever been created
>* Bitcoin is **as significant to decentralizing power
and increasing financial inclusion,** as the invention
of the printing press, and later the World Wide
Web, **was to decentralizing control of, and
increasing access to, information.**


>*A lot of people automatically
dismiss e-currency as a lost cause
because of all the companies that failed
since the 1990’s.
I hope it’s obvious it was only the
centrally controlled nature of those
systems that doomed them.
I think this is the first time we’re trying
a decentralized, non-trust-based system.*

* Except the ‘who’ isn’t a name, **it is an address
made up of numbers and letters.**
>* An example of a bitcoin address:
**bc1qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwf5mdq**

* **Bitcoin is a record keeper that uses mathematics and
computer science, instead of bankers, bookkeepers
and accountants.**
* It eliminates the middlemen, banks, govts, overdraft
fees, checking account fees, limited hours of service,
potential for censorship, frozen accounts, manipulation of the money supply, interest rates, the IMF,
the WEF, the BIS, brick-and-mortar buildings, ATMs,
checks, chargebacks, the petro dollar, the euro
dollar, bank seigniorage, the cantillon effect,
fractional reserve banking, visa, mastercard, amex,

## Put Simply…
* **Bitcoin is digital property that no one can take from
you.**
* >Owning bitcoin means owning the right to send value
from a specific address that you control with
your private key to ANY other address you choose.

*Bitcoin is a property right that is independent of
the monopoly on violence.*

* **Bitcoin is a once-in-a-species event.**
* Bitcoin is choice.
* Bitcoin **engenders sovereignty.**
>* **The discovery of Bitcoin 15 years ago, is to
human financial freedom and sovereignty, as the
discovery of fire was to human flourishing over
500,000 years ago, and the printing press was to
decentralizing access to human knowledge nearly
900 years ago.**

* **Bitcoin is a true store of value.**
* It stores your most precious resource, your time, in
such a way that you can access it again later.

* Bitcoin is a timechain, literally.
* Satoshi referred to the timechain many times in
his emails with the early devs.
* You can measure time in blocks, since one block
is mined every ~10 minutes.
>* **Our time is our most scarce and precious resource.**
>* **It is our literal life force.**
>* **True Money allows us to store our time.**

* It is the way we can acknowledge the time we ‘spent’.
* We **trade our time for money, which is simply a record
of our time and effort.**
* **Bitcoin makes it possible to preserve our time such
that we have ‘access’ to it later in life, when
we are no longer able to work as we once did.**

* Bitcoin **will one day be *THE unit of account.***
---
* **Bitcoin is scarce**
* It has a hard cap of 21,000,000. 
* There will never be more.
* Code is law here.*

*While it is ‘technically’ possible to change the
code, Satoshi’s genius prevents that, since increasing
(inflating) the supply would only serve to decrease the
value of all bitcoin in circulation. This therefore
incentivizes everyone to implicitly agree to maintain
the 21,000,000 hard cap supply.

* Check out **timechaincalendar.com** by @TC to check
the current block height, the available supply, and
numerous other metrics with regard to the bitcoin
timechain.
---
* **Bitcoin is infinitely divisible, without debasing the
supply.**
* **One pizza is one pizza, regardless of how small the
slices are.**
* It is currently divisible to the eighth
decimal: 1.00000000
* There are 100,000,000 satoshis in 1 bitcoin.
* 1 satoshi = 0.00000001
* You can buy sats (satoshis) in any amount.
---
* **Bitcoin is the hardest, soundest money we have ever
known.**
* It is even sounder than gold, since gold is not easily
divisible or portable, has low velocity (moves slowly)
and is not easily verifiable
* **Bitcoin has the most superior monetary properties
of any asset ever known.**

* **Bitcoin is the antidote.**
* Attempting to ‘stabilize’ the economy with bailouts,
money printing, QE and interest rate manipulation is
like having it on artificial life support
* This ‘machine’ can only go on so long, before becoming more and more expensive to maintain, and less
and less sustainable, leading to a serious breakdown.
* **Bitcoin fixes this**
* **Bitcoin is better money**
---
* **Bitcoin is anti-fragile.**
* And it gets more so with every attempted attack,
with every government ban, with every piece of mainstream media FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt).
>* Bitcoin has never been hacked.*
* Though many have tried.

*Although you may have heard of hacks, it is
the exchanges that have been hacked, not
the bitcoin protocol.
* **Remember:**
* Not your keys, not your coins.

* Humans need bitcoin, bitcoin needs humans.
---
* **Bitcoin is the solution to the Byzantine General’s
problem.**
* This was once thought to be an unsolvable problem in
computer science
* This problem arises in decentralized systems, where
it was thought impossible to prove that message sent
= message received, since the ‘man-in-the-middle’
could be a bad actor and falsify the message.
* In other words, it seemed impossible to form consensus amongst a network of distributed and independent computers.
* By using a timestamp along with a cryptographically secured distributed ledger, Satoshi solved this
problem.
* His solution is known as **Nakamoto’s consensus.**
---
* **Bitcoin is the solution to the double-spend problem.**
* This means that when you send bitcoin, the receiver
can be sure that you actually owned the bitcoin you
sent, and, that once you sent it to them you cannot
spend those coins again by sending them to someone
else (double-spending).
* Just like me giving you an orange. Once it leaves
my hands and is in your hands, I no longer have
the orange to give to someone else.
>*..double-spends are never accepted into the
transaction pool, so every node bears
witness to which transaction it saw first
by working to put it into a block.*

~ Satoshi Nakamoto 2010-12-09

---
* **Bitcoin is a bearer asset,** like cash or gold, held by
the bearer (owner) directly

>* **This means that, once sent (given), it goes directly
to the new bearer (owner), with no middleman
(bank) needed to process the transaction.**

---
* **Bitcoin is P2P (peer-to-peer).**
* Bitcoin is censorship-resistant
>*  **This means that no one has the power to hold up
or to prevent a transaction from going through to
the new bearer.**
* Bitcoin flows freely.

* There can be no gatekeepers.
---
* **Bitcoin is trustless.**
>*The root problem with conventional
currency is all the trust that’s required
to make it work. The central bank must be
trusted not to debase the currency, but
the history of fiat currencies is full of
breaches of that trust.*

Bitcoin’s trustless nature.

## SATOSHI’s GENIUS
>* Bitcoin is **ALL** of the following:
> * A decentralized, distributed ledger
> * A payment system
> * And the value itself being transferred.

* Outside of bitcoin, **money creation** (issuance), and
**accounting** (keeping track of money received/spent),
**is centralized,** and includes the following separate
layers:

* Various Central Banks' issuance of money
* The ledgers of account, whether written or digital
* The trusted parties who enter the numbers into
the ledgers
* The trusted parties who keep the physical ledgers
safe, or who maintain the computer databases
* The trusted security teams who work to prevent
hacking of the databases

* With bitcoin, **all these layers are folded into one!**
* While this might sound more centralized, Satoshi’s
genius made it such that the opposite is true.
* It is **100% Decentralized!**

---

>* **Bitcoin has NO central point of failure.**

* The only way it could all be rolled into one, and be
decentralized, is that **the distributed ledger is
main-tained by a voluntary, world-wide, ad hoc
group of people voluntarily mining and/or running
full nodes.**
* And, the incentives of the network **encourage everyone to play by the rules**
* You can join us!

goods and services provided, we transact: give
and receive bitcoin, or we store it for use later, as
needed.

## NODES 
* **Nodes are computers that run the bitcoin

## A BITCOIN TRANSACTION:
Ali wants to send Benji some bitcoin:

>1. Ali **opens the bitcoin wallet** app on her phone and
>**clicks ‘Send’.**
>2. Benji **opens his wallet app** and **clicks ‘Receive’.**
>3. **If they are together:** Ali scans the QR code on the
>wallet app on Benji’s phone.
>4. **If they are not together:** Ali copies and pastes the
>address Benji texts her, into the address field in her
>wallet.
>5. Ali **enters the amount to send,** and hits **‘Send’.**
>6. **A few seconds later,** Benji will see the amount
>pending in his wallet.
>7. **If it was sent through Lightning** it will be confirmed
>almost instantly, and is almost free.
>8. **If it was sent ‘onchain’** (on the Bitcoin mainchain),
>it includes a small fee, and usually takes around 10
>minutes to be confirmed. It can take longer,
>depending on network traffic.

---

## A BITCOIN TRANSACTION UNDER THE HOOD: 
(Definitions of the terms that are **in bold** follow)

>1. When Ali sends those sats to Benji, the payment
>**transaction** is **broadcast** to the network.
>2. The transaction gets validated by **nodes** that
>make sure Ali really has the bitcoin to send, and
>that it has not previously been spent (to prevent
>double-spending) .
>3. Once validated by a node, it waits in the **mempool**
>with other peoples' transactions.
>4. The transactions in the mempool get added in a
>block to the **blockchain** when a **miner** finds a >**nonce**
>that satisfies the **difficulty algorithm.**
>5. Each **block** has a **timestamp.**
>6. This creates **immutability,** and helps protect the
>difficulty algorithm adjustment from being
>manipulated.
>7. Each block represents one confirmation for the
>transactions included in it.
>8. As blocks are added, on average every ten mins,
>the immutability of the blockchain increases.

## GLOSSARY OF TERMS

---
>* **TRANSACTION ~ Sending/receiving bitcoin**
---
* A transfer of value in the form of satoshis, from
one bitcoin holder to another.

---
>* **NODE ~ A ‘branch’ of the decentralized bitcoin
‘bank’. Anyone can run a node.**
---

* Nodes are computers that run the bitcoin
software.
* Nodes, along with miners, users and
developers, form the peer-to-peer Bitcoin
network.
* Imagine **each full node as a ledger containing the
balances of every private key.**
* They interact, and reach consensus (agree) with
one another by accepting and validating
transactions from other nodes, along with blocks
from miners, and then relaying these onward to
other nodes.
* Nodes are run by an ad-hoc group of thousands
of volunteers around the world.
* A full node is one that has independently
validated the entire Bitcoin blockchain, since the
Genesis Block mined by Satoshi in 2009.
* The more active nodes there are, the more distributed, and therefore resilient, the whole network
becomes.
* There are **currently over 19,000 reachable full
nodes worldwide, & far more unreachable ones.**
* All participating nodes are equal.

---

---
>* **BROADCAST ~ Letting the network know you are
sending bitcoin to someone.**
---

* When you click ‘Send’, your wallet signs the transaction with your private key and broadcasts it,
letting all the other nodes know of your intention
to transfer value so that they can validate the
transaction

---
>* **MEMPOOL ~ A transaction waiting room**
---

* This is the ‘waiting room’ where validated transactions are sent to be picked up by a miner and
added to a block.

---
>* **BLOCK ~ A ‘page’ in the bitcoin ledger**
---

* The Bitcoin distributed ledger is made up of digital ‘blocks’.
* Each block contains verified bitcoin transactions
that keep the global ledger accurate and current.
They also contain the nonce, a time-stamp and a
hash of the previous block, all of which
contribute to the immutability of the bitcoin
blockchain.

---
>* **BLOCKCHAIN ~ The whole bitcoin ledger**
---

* The bitcoin blockchain, also known as the
timechain, is the distributed ledger that contains
every block, and every bitcoin transaction ever
made since the Genesis block was mined by
Satoshi in 2009.

---

---
>* **MINER ~ A specialized node that both confirms
transactions and issues new bitcoins**
---

* Bitcoin miners are specialized computers. They
direct lots of computing power (hashrate) in a
digital lottery to guess a number that will satisfy
the current difficulty algorithm, thereby ‘mining’
a ‘block’ (a piece of the ledger).
* A mined block is timestamped and added to the
blockchain (aka timechain).

---
>* **DIFFICULTY ALGORITHM ~ A special, adaptive
design that helps keep new bitcoin issuance
predictable.**
---

* This was one of Satoshi’s genius solutions to help
protect the bitcoin issuance from outrunning itself,
as more advanced computers are developed.
* When more miners come online, the target number (nonce) in the ‘lottery’ gets smaller, and therefore more difficult to find.
* When less miners are online, it gets easier.
* The algorithm **adjusts automatically every 2016
blocks** (about every two weeks), to ensure a predictable rate of supply, where one block is mined
on average every ten minutes.

---
>* **NONCE ~ A 32-bit random number**
---

* A 32-bit random number that miners add to the
end of the hashed list of transactions, to attempt
to satisfy the difficulty target to mine a block.
* When a miner finds a nonce that leads to
generating a hash below the current target
number, they have mined a block and get to add
it to the blockchain and claim the bitcoin block
reward.
---

---
>* **TIMESTAMP ~ Stamps the time**
---

* Every block mined has a timestamp added to it.
* This is for added security, immutability and to help
establish the difficulty adjustment

---
>* **IMMUTABILITY ~ Cannot be changed.**
---

* This means the blockchain is ‘set in digital stone’.

---
>* **PROOF-OF-WORK (PoW) ~ Cryptographic proof
that difficult work was done to satisfy an algorithm.**
---

*  Miners use the PoW algorithm to prove they have
used a lot of computational power via electricity
(work), in order to achieve consensus in a decentralized manner, and to prevent corrupt actors
from spamming the network.

---
>* **PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY ~ A process that
creates the digital keys to access your bitcoins**
---

* This is a system whereby two keys are created
through a cryptographic algorithm.
* **One key is public** - Like your bank account number, that you can give people to send bitcoin to
you for goods, gifts or services.
* **The other key is private** - Only you have a copy,
and you use it to unlock access to your bitcoin,
just as a password unlocks your online bank
account.
* **You must secure your private key very well,**
since anyone who has access to it has access to
your bitcoin.

---

---
>* **PEER-TO-PEER (P2P) NETWORK ~ A decentralized
network with no middlemen**
---

* Full nodes (peers) collaboratively maintain a peerto-peer network for transaction and block validation and verification.
* In this type of network, each node is able to
both provide/request data to/from its peers.
* There are no gatekeepers in a P2P network.

---
>* **LIGHTNING NETWORK ~ A network built on bitcoin that makes it possible to send or receive
sats very fast and almost for free.**
---

* Lightning is a Layer 2 scaling solution. This means
it provides a way for bitcoin to scale, giving it the
potential to process millions of transactions per
second (TPS).

---
>* **WALLET ~ A ‘wallet’ holds the cryptographic
keys to access your bitcoin.**
---

* It can be on a phone, computer or on a separate
small hardware device (the safest).
* A bitcoin wallet would more accurately be called a
signing device. Your bitcoin never actually leaves
the blockchain, the digital ledger.
* When you wish to send or spend your bitcoin, the
wallet will sign and broadcast the transaction to
the network, so that it can be validated and
added into a block on the blockchain.

---
>* **DEVELOPERS ~ Computer programmers**
---

* Cypherpunks/programmers that maintain the network, improve security, check for bugs, submit
pull requests (for new updates or features), review
pull requests, audit the code.

---

---
>* **PUBLIC KEY ~ Like a bank account number for
receiving bitcoin.**
---

* You can give it to people to send you bitcoin,
just like you would give your account number to
someone so they can send you fiat

---
>* **PRIVATE KEY ~ For securing, accessing and sending bitcoin, like the key to a safety deposit box.**
---

* A bitcoin private key is a secret string of numbers
and letters that allows you to send/spend your
bitcoin.
* Only you have a copy. ** **It is very important to
keep it very safe and secure, as anyone who
obtains a copy can spend your bitcoin.** **

---
>* **DISTRIBUTED LEDGER ~ A ledger maintained by
everyone who wishes to help maintain it.**
---

* Instead of a centrally-controlled ledger that is
invisible to the public, like one that a bank maintains, Bitcoin is a transparent, open, decentralized
ledger visible to anyone, anytime.
* The addresses are strings of letters and numbers,
with no names attached.
* While pseudonymous, it is possible to track transactions, especially if the bitcoin was bought from
a centralized KYC exchange.
* The Bitcoin network is trustless and anyone can
audit it anytime, unlike a bank where one must
trust that the ledgers are being kept honestly.

* **Miners devote computing power AKA hashrate,
via electricity to the network,** to add blocks to the
Bitcoin blockchain.
* These computers run 24 hours a day, usually in sets
of a few, to a few hundred or thousand.
* **They are basically running a lottery. When one of
them guesses a number** (the nonce) that generates a
hash that satisfies the current difficulty target, **they
get to add the next block to the timechain.**
* **All the above is the proof-of-work (PoW) needed to
birth new bitcoins.**

---

## BITCOIN BLOCK REWARD 
**= Subsidy + Fees**

>* **For their work, miners get:**
> * **A subsidy, in the form of freshly minted bitcoins.**
> * **Plus, the fees from the verified transactions
>included in that block**

* **When you send bitcoin to someone, that transaction
includes a fee** and needs to be verified by a miner,
and then included in a block.
* The **bitcoin block subsidy** gets cut in half every four
years
* It is **currently 3.125 bitcoin** per block that is mined.
* **The next ‘halving’ will be in 2028,** at which point
the block reward will drop to 1.5625 bitcoin per
block mined.
* As mentioned before, **this keeps the issuance stable.**
* **In the year 2140, the last piece of bitcoin will be
mined.**
* After that, miners will only get the fees from the transactions they verify in each block.

>*In a few decades when the reward gets too
small, the transaction fee will become the
main compensation for nodes (miners).*

~ Satoshi Nakamoto
Bitcointalk.org, 2010-02-14

>* **Miners will always be needed to verify transactions,
thereby keeping the network updated and secure.**

* While one needs to be aware that there are costs
involved, and profitability is negligible for home
miners, it is a powerful way to help secure and keep
the network decentralized.
* Miners last quite a few years. There are currently many
Antminer S9’s for example, that have been running
for over 6 years.
* When miners are retired **they can easily be taken
apart and recycled.**
* **Tons of fascinating innovation is happening,** with
people using the excess heat from miners to
heat their homes, saunas, greenhouses, hot tubs,
dry jerky and vegetables, heat decks, dry wood and
more!

# Chapter 5

# A WORD ON THE LIGHTNING NETWORK
* **Bitcoin blocks are intentionally small*** (1MB each),
resulting in the bitcoin mainchain being able to process about 7 transactions per second (TPS).
* Visa processes about 24,000 TPS.
* Also, **it generally takes about 10 minutes for the
first confirmation to go through on a mainchain
transaction** (since a block is mined on
average every ~10 minutes).
* This is not practical if you are at a store and want to
make a quick payment for your goods.

> ***Important Detail:** The reason the blocks are small,
is to keep **the timechain small enough for anyone to
run their own node at home, which helps keep the
network decentralized.** Satoshi realized the
importance of this

>*Bitcoin users might get increasingly
tyrannical about limiting the size of
the chain so it’s easy for lots of users
and small devices.*

~ Satoshi Nakamoto, 2010-12-10

**Recommended Reading:**
* The Blocksize War by Jonathan Bier

>* Enter, the **Lightning Network (LN),** a **Layer 2 bitcoin
>scaling solution.**
>* **‘Layer 2’** means **it is built on top of bitcoin.**
>* **‘Scaling Solution’** means it allows the network to:
>* ** Vastly increase the speed of processing.**
>* **Vastly increase the number of transactions it
>can process per second.**
>* **Make micropayments possible.**

* The Lightning Network can be (sort of) thought of like
a tab you might keep with some friends at the bar.
* You keep track between all of you who owes what
(like a Lightning Network channel), and at the end
of the night your group settles with the barman
(‘the mainchain’).
* **Lightning channels, however, can stay open for
days, weeks, months or years before being
‘settled’ on the mainchain.**

---
## BENEFITS OF :
* **VOLUME** - The volume of transactions per second is
in essence limitless, as countless channels can be
opened at the same time, each keeping their own
‘tab’.
* **MICROPAYMENTS** - You can send as little as 1
satoshi (currently $0.0006).
* **SPEED** - It usually takes between a millisecond and a
few seconds to receive a payment.
* **PRIVACY** - Transactions are not stored on the open,
public bitcoin blockchain. In some ways it is even
more private than cash, because with Lightning,
even the other party does not necessarily know who
you are, as your payment often ‘hops’ through
different channels to reach the receiver.

To be clear, I am not saying it is 100% impossible to
uncover, just far more so than with payments on the
bitcoin mainchain.
It would take an immense amount of time and energy
to establish with certainty who was making payments
to whom, and it would not always be possible to
do so at all.

>*Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every
single financial transaction in the
world be broadcast to everyone and
included in the blockchain.
There needs to be a secondary level of
payment systems which is lighter
weight and more efficient.*

*~ Hal Finney, 2010-12-30, Early cypherpunk
& the second person to run Bitcoin*

**Think of it like this:**
>* Bitcoin: **Savings Account** ~ Slower transactions for
>larger amounts.
>* Lightning: **Checking Account** ~ Faster transactions
>for smaller amounts.


>*Bitcoin enhanced by Lightning can be viewed as both a
product (digital property) and a service (open monetary
network). The ability to transfer monetary energy through
time and space without government intervention or
conventional banking is enormously valuable to humanity.*

~ Michael Saylor, CEO
Microstrategy

# Chapter 6

# HOW TO BITCOIN

>**To Bitcoin:** (verb) /tuːˈbɪtkɔɪn/
I hereby propose making ‘to bitcoin’ a verb,
that encapsulates the fullness of participating
in the bitcoin/Bitcoin eco-system.

* Ok, now that you have, hopefully ;) been orangepilled, and are ready to become your own bank, participating in the world’s first global freedom money,
here comes the fun part!

---

## BECOMING YOUR OWN BANK
* This is where the really epic shift in becoming finacially self-sovereign lies, and, it can take time to
really, truly grasp what this means.
* Some **intention and dedication is required to
understand how to do it in the most secure way
possible.**
* In the spirit of keeping this book ‘the simplest
bitcoin book ever written’, I will provide an
outline here, and then I offer resources at the end
for you to dive in to that go much deeper than
the scope of this primer.

>**HODL:** (verb) /ho’dill/

: to hold on to your bitcoin

: to not sell

-From a 2013 bitcointalk.org post, where the poster
professing to be drunk, misspelled ‘HOLD’

-bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0

* While the network is still growing, there is much
value in the millions of global hodl’rs of last resort.

---

## ACQUIRING BITCOIN
* **Bitcoin enters the market by miners selling some of
the bitcoins they receive as rewards,** in order to pay
for their operating costs.
* **You can acquire bitcoin by buying on a peer-to-peer
trading platform, by accepting it as payment for
goods or services you offer, as a gift, or by mining
it.** (A very last resort, not recommended, is to buy it
from a registered exchange).
* When you receive it, you are technically receiving the
private keys with which to access your bitcoin.
> * **Remember:** The bitcoin itself never leaves the
 timechain.

* You can acquire bitcoin either anonymously, or
with ID verification (KYC - Know Your Customer)

* KYC is required by law to fulfill AML (anti-money laundering laws) when buying from exchanges.

>* Buying non-KYC bitcoin **preserves your right to
privacy in the future.**

---

## Non-KYC >> Anonymously
**How to Get non-KYC Bitcoin (No ID):**

RECOMMENDED

>1. Download a bitcoin-only wallet app (see pg 102).
>2. Choose a method (see below).
>3. Buy, receive or mine bitcoin.
>4. Withdraw your bitcoin to your wallet.
>5. HODL, or spend and replace.

* **Buy it from Robosats, Bisq, HodlHodl, Peach Bitcoin.**
* **Buy it from a bitcoin ATM** - Be sure to check, as
some require ID. Others just ask for a name and
number (you can use a temporary phone #).
* **Buy an Azteco voucher** - Visit azte.co for locations.
* **Earn it for work you do** - Ask to be paid in bitcoin.
Offer to discount your price.
* **Buy it in person at a bitcoin meet-up.**
* **Mine it** - It is getting easier to mine at home, or
you can join a mining pool, but then DYOR to stay
KYC-free. Ocean Pool is a great option.

---

## KYC >> ID Verification Required

**How to Buy KYC Bitcoin (with ID):**

NOT RECOMMENDED

>1. Download a bitcoin-only wallet app (see pg 102).
>2. Choose a bitcoin-only exchange.
>3. Create an account & link a payment method.
>4. Fulfill the KYC requirements.
>5. Buy bitcoin.
>6. **Withdraw your bitcoin to your own wallet.**
>7. HODL or spend and replace.

* **Be aware that your bitcoin will be forever linked to
your identity** if you buy it this way, thus forfeiting
future pseudonymity with regard to these purchases.
* If you choose this method, I recommend finding a
reputable ***bitcoin-only exchange***
* ***Be sure the exchange allows you to withdraw your
bitcoin to your own wallet!***
* **Exchanges are required by law to ‘KYC’ you.**
* They will take **your full name, address, social security
number, email, phone number and often a photo of
you holding your ID.**
* **Confirm that the exchange has both phone and email
support** for customer service.

---

* Have them walk you through sending your bitcoin
from your account with them to your own wallet, so
that you are self-custodying your bitcoin
= **Holding your own keys.**

>* **Note:** This does NOT erase the fact you
>bought bitcoin from them.
>* **Transactions are traceable on-chain, and in
>many countries you are liable for taxation when
>spending your bitcoin.**

* If you want to buy through Venmo or Paypal, be
sure to **first confirm that you can still withdraw
your sats to your own self-hosted wallet.** In the
past you could not do so.
* As they say:
> **“No keys, No cheese”** or
>
>**“Not your keys, Not your bitcoin”**

* What this means is, so long as a centralized service is
holding the private keys to your bitcoin, there remains
the possibility that their platform gets hacked, or that
they undergo regulatory capture and you lose your
bitcoin.

>* **Always withdraw your bitcoin to your own
self-hosted wallet as soon as you have
bought it.**

---
## EO 6102
* In 1933 **President Roosevelt issued Executive Order
6102, which required every US citizen to turn in
most of their gold in exchange for bank notes.**
* The gold was valued at $20.67/oz. The following
year, the government increased the price of gold to
$35/oz with the Gold Reserve Act of 1934,
effectively devaluing the notes people had
received by almost half, since the value of their
notes never went up with the inflated gold price.

![under executive](figure-09-under%20executive.png)

---

* It took until 1975, **42 years later, for EO6102 to
be repealed,** and for private citizens to once again
be allowed to hold more than 5oz of gold.
* At this stage, we have little idea how the regulators
are going to respond to bitcoin as it continues to
gain popularity and more widespread adoption.
* So far, there has been a mixed reception. For the
time being however, it seems that many
understand, or perhaps just accept, that bitcoin
cannot ultimately be stopped.
* There are a number of politicians starting to speak
in support of bitcoin as part of their platform.
There are also some against it.
* Being an election year in the US, 2024 is very
interesting, with all three major Presidential
candidates accepting bitcoin campaign donations!
* El Salvador made it a form of legal tender in 2021.
It will be interesting to see which country is next.

>* **Ultimately, it would be in the interest of every government to embrace it and add it to their balance
sheet, as a hedge against their rapidly inflating
fiat currencies.**

---

## SECURELY STORING BITCOIN

* Once you have taken the life-changing step of buying your first , you need to **decide how to securely
store it.**
>* **Being your own bank is a powerful form of
>self-sovereignty.**
>* It needs to be taken **seriously**
* ***Please DYOR - Do Your Own Research * beyond
my basic recommendations here.**
* The **bitcoin ecosystem is evolving every minute.**
* Nostr, Twitter and bitcointalk.org are good
places to stay on top of the latest developments.

## BITCOIN-ONLY WALLETS
* Bitcoin is best stored in your own
 * **self-hosted**
 * **non-custodial**
 * **bitcoin-only** ‘wallet’

* A ‘wallet’ is actually a piece of software which is a
signing device. It contains your private keys which it
uses to sign a transaction you send (broadcast).

## HOT WALLET
* **This is an online bitcoin wallet app that you download to your phone or computer.**
* It is best used for smaller amounts, for day-to-day
spending
## COLD STORAGE WALLET
* **This is an offline wallet.** Also known as a hardware
wallet
* It is a separate hardware device on which to store
your keys. 

>* While both work well, it is generally recommended
to make use of a cold wallet once you have over
$500-1000 worth of bitcoin, as it is **more secure.**

---
* **Please DYOR to compare the features and
trade-offs between the wallets shown below.**

* **HOT WALLET APPS** - Non-Custodial
Blue Wallet, Muun Wallet, Mutiny Wallet
Sparrow Wallet, Green Wallet, Phoenix

![B](figure-023-B.png)

>* **ALWAYS** purchase your cold storage wallet **direct
from the manufacturer,** to be certain it has not been
tampered with.

---

## WALLET SETUP
* Follow @BTCSessions on YouTube for excellent
tutorials on wallet set-up, and lots more.

>* When setting up your wallet, be sure to ***write down
>the 12- or 24-word Seed Phrase on paper.***
>* ***Keep it offline. Never take a screenshot of it.***
>* **STORE THE SEED PHRASE VERY SAFELY.**
>* **VERY, VERY SAFELY!**

* **Many companies make metal seed plates into
which you can punch your seed phrase for added
fire/water/damage protection. Highly recommend!**
* If you were to lose access to your hot or cold wallet,
you can restore it with the seed phrase and recover
your funds.
* You can do so on any wallet that supports the same
type of BIP39 seed phrase (12/24 words).
* Best practice would be to store the wallet
descriptor of your wallet in addition to your seed.
>* **REMEMBER: Anyone who has your seed has
access to your bitcoin!**

---
## ON PRIVACY
* Privacy when **buying (non-KYC), securing, storing
and spending** bitcoin is becoming more and more
important, especially in light of recent events with
bank accounts being seized/frozen.
>* In addition, **general digital privacy is critical if you
wish to gain online sovereignty, and protect yourself from undue surveillance and fraud.**

* Below are some current privacy-focused services.
* It is beyond the scope of this book to go deeply into
each of the following, so absolutely DYOR, and
follow the accounts I mention below on Nostr or
Twitter for updates.

>*Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic
age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something
one doesn’t want the whole world to know, but a secret
matter is something one doesn’t want anybody to know.
Privacy is the power to selectively reveal
oneself to the world.*

#  Dispelling Bitcoin Fud
(Fear Uncertainty Doubt)

* Below are some common arguments against, or fears
about, bitcoin.
* These are largely unfounded, resulting from ignorance, or perhaps incomplete understanding.
* I provide brief rebuttals to each here, and at the end
you will find pointers to more in-depth resources
rebutting all the FUD.

## BITCOIN USES TOO MUCH ENERGY

>*The heat from your computer is not wasted
if you need to heat your home… It’s
equal cost if you generate the heat
with your computer.*

~ Satoshi Nakamoto 2010-08-09

>*At first, the production of a commodity simply because it
is costly seems quite wasteful. However, the unforgeably
costly commodity repeatedly adds value by enabling
beneficial wealth transfers. More of the cost is recouped
every time a transaction is made possible or made
less expensive. The cost, initially a complete waste, is
amortized over many transactions.*

~ Nick Szabo

Cypherpunk

---

* **‘Too much’ energy is a value proposition that must
consider how we value the purpose of the energy
use.**

* **When one considers that the Christmas lights in the
US use as much electricity as the entire Bitcoin network,** then perhaps one can see that it is all relative!

* Using energy, even a whole lot of energy, to secure
the hardest, most censorship-resistant money
humanity has ever known, is more than worth it.

* In comparing bitcoin energy usage to that used by
the legacy system, we also need to consider the ‘full
stack’ on both sides:

| Bitcoin Ecosystem    | Legacy Fiat System          |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| ASIC Miners          | BIS                         |
| Nodes                | Central Banks               |
| Hardware Wallets     | National/Regional Banks     |
| Software Wallet Apps | Military Industrial Complex |
|                      | Backup Data Centers         |
|                      | Physical Money Printing     |
|                      | Physical Money Distribution |
|                      | Online Banking Apps         |
|                      | Network of ATMs             |

* By using bitcoin, we will ultimately reduce energy
usage in a multitude of other areas, most notably
by no longer needing the Military Industrial
Complex to protect the petro dollar

---

* Also, the rampant consumerism that is required to
keep the debt-based system afloat, will over time
be curtailed, as **hard money naturally incentivizes
prudent spending and saving** (since your savings
will actually hold their value, a concept we have not
experienced since being off the gold standard).
* **Lastly, and importantly, bitcoin mining is already
reducing pollution by capturing flared natural gas
and using it to power the miners.** Since miners seek
low electricity costs, it is also likely to be the biggest
driver toward renewable low cost energy, since the
incentives match up.
* **Informed deep dives on Bitcoin and Energy** have
been written by Daniel Batten on batcoinz.com, Troy
Cross, Jyn Urso, the video ‘This Machine Greens’
by Swan Bitcoin on YouTube, 'Dirty Coin', A
bitcoin mining documentary, and an
excellent episode of the ‘What is Money’ show
(WiM161) with B.Quittem, among many others.

---

## BITCOIN IS A PONZI
* **Bitcoin is not a Ponzi:**
 * Old investors are not paid any money by new
 investors.
 * When buying bitcoin, no one is promising a return
 on your investment.
 * There is no leadership or promotions team.
 * There was no pre-mine.
 * **Read:** ‘Why Bitcoin is Not a Ponzi’ by Lyn Alden
for more.

## BITCOIN IS TOO SLOW
* While the Bitcoin base layer is slow, the 2
nd layer
**Lightning Network built on the base layer is …
lightning fast!**
* Bitcoin’s network can process about 7
transactions per second (TPS).
* The Visa network claims it can process up to 24,000
TPS, although 4,000 TPS is closer to actual usage.
* **The Lightning Network, a second layer solution
built on Bitcoin, has the potential capacity to
process millions of transactions per second!**

---

## GOVERNMENTS COULD BAN BITCOIN
* Some governments have tried, like China, India and
Nigeria for example. In each case, the use of bitcoin
rises rapidly by the people of said country
* **There is no way for governments to truly ‘ban’ bitcoin,** as it is by its nature permissionless and censorship-resistant. It is code and code is speech.
* That said, governments can make it harder to buy
and sell with, and into fiat. They can also tax it as a
commodity, like they do in the US.
* **Ultimately, it will not be in their favor to try and ban
it, since bitcoin is inevitable and they are starting
to see that.** They would be far smarter to add it to
their country’s balance sheet as a hedge against their
inflating fiat currencies.

>*Governments are good at cutting off the
heads of centrally controlled networks
like Napster, but pure P2P networks
like Gnutella and Tor seem to be
holding their own.*

~ Satoshi Nakamoto

* **Read:**

Can Government Stop Bitcoin? by Alex Gladstein,
CSO of the Human Rights Foundation

Can the Government Ban Bitcoin? Four Things You
Need to Know by Nick Giambruno

---

## BITCOIN IS OLD TECH
* **More like ‘ultimate tech’,** with regards to digital
scarcity, decentralization and solving both the double-spending problem and the Byzantine General’s
problem. Once discovered, it cannot be re-discovered.
* **Once the wheel was invented, it could never be
reinvented.**
* The TCP/IP protocol that the internet runs on has
been the standard for all computer networking since
1983. It is likely to continue being the standard for a
long time.
* Once a prefect-solution, base layer technology is discovered that works optimally, it can last for hundreds,
or thousands of years.

## BITCOIN IS USED BY CRIMINALS
* **So is the dollar, and every other fiat currency in the
world.** It is simply incorrect to attribute this
problem only to bitcoin.
* **Bitcoin is a tool, just like a knife, and it is up to each
one of us how we use it.**
* Interestingly, if bitcoin couldn't be used by criminals,
then it would not be the neutral, censorship-resistant
money the world so badly needs.
* **Note:** Since the Bitcoin blockchain is auditable, it is
actually a really bad choice for criminal activity!

## QUANTUM COMPUTING COULD BREAK BITCOIN
* While this may be a possibility one day in the future,
**developers are already working on solutions for postquantum encryption**
* Bitcoin is only one of a multitude of online applications that rely on SHA-256 hashing for security.
Even the military uses it, so there is massive incentive beyond the bitcoin community to develop new
encryption protocols.
* If SHA-256 is broken, we will have a lot else to
worry about beyond bitcoin. The entire internet uses
it for encryption. This includes all banking, supply
chains, transportation systems, healthcare systems,
education systems and more.

---

## BITCOIN HAS NO REAL VALUE
>*“Bitcoin's value is driven by its enforceable scarcity”*

*~ Fidelity Digital Assets*

* **Rarity is the value. All money over all time has been
valued because it had some measure of scarcity.**

* In addition, it was backed by the belief that it would
hold its value, such that it could be traded in the
future for something else of value.
* As the Bitcoin network grows, backed by the superior
monetary properties it embodies, the network effect
grows exponentially
* The larger the network effect, the more value it, as a
scarce asset, offers. Value is a reflection of demand,
and as demand increases, value increases.

---

## SOME PEOPLE HAVE TOO MUCH
* It is true that some people have far more than others.
**In releasing the protocol openly, Satoshi allowed it to
roam freely, and those that understood the potential
it held either mined, or bought in early. It was the
fairest and most organic way possible to present it
to the world.**
* Over time, when the world is hyperbitcoinized, meaning we are living on a bitcoin standard, those that
have more will naturally spend it into the economy

* Even though at a certain point one will no longer be
able to buy it with fiat, people will get paid for their
work in bitcoin. Being paid in truly sound money will
allow us to have real savings that will not be debased
over time by inflation
* While there will always be those with more wealth
and those with less, due to a vast number of factors,
**a bitcoin standard will make the membrane between
wealth classes permeable**, as Aleks Svetsi says. This
will allow both upward and downward mobility to be
far, far more fluid than it is today
* **Having been born into, and swimming our whole lives
in a fiat world, it is almost impossible to imagine, and
fully grok the implications of having a money that
cannot be debased or manipulated!**

---
## BITCOIN IS TOO VOLATILE
* **This is normal during the price discovery phase of
a new monetary asset.** There is no other way for
growth to happen when it is organic and emergent
(as opposed to top down and centrally controlled.
* In addition, at this stage of human existence, with
exponential shifts happening in all spheres, it makes
sense that something as rEVOLutionary as bitcoin will
have wild swings.
* While those of us deep down the rabbit hole see it
as the future, currently only a small percent of the
global population holds bitcoin at this time. This
makes it vulnerable to immense volatility.
* As it matures, and adoption increases, the volatility will decrease, and eventually it will stabilize and
become a unit of account.

>*I’m sure that in 20 years there will
either be very large transaction
volume or no volume.*

~ Satoshi Nakamoto 2010-02-14

## YOU CAN’T TOUCH A BITCOIN

* **This is a feature, not a bug.** The very fact that bitcoin
is not physical is one of the biggest factors contributing to it’s unconfiscatability!

## BITCOIN COULD GET HACKED

* In the 15 years since it was launched, it has never
been hacked.
* There have been hacks at exchanges however, so I
highly recommend moving your bitcoin to your own
self-custody wallet as soon as possible.
* It has been estimated that to break the SHA-256
encryption (that bitcoin uses) within 24 hours, a
quantum computer would need 13,000,000 physical
qubits. At this time, the current qubit record held
by Atom Computing in California is 1,180 qubits.
* It is widely assumed that a quantum-safe encryption
method will be developed well before it is needed.

>*Being open source means anyone can
independently review the code. If it was
closed source, nobody could verify the
security. I think it’s essential for a
program of this nature to be open source.*

*~Satoshi Nakamoto 2009-12-10*

>*Bitcoin is fundamentally different from any other digital
asset. No other digital asset is likely to improve upon
bitcoin as a monetary good because bitcoin is the most
(relative to other digital assets) secure, decentralized,
sound digital money and any “improvement”
will necessarily face tradeoffs.*

## ON THE PRICE OF BITCOIN
* **I see hodling (holding) bitcoin like having a long-term
savings account.**
* The daily price doesn’t matter, as it is expected to be
volatile (go up and down) for some years yet.
* As I mentioned previously, this is normal for a new
asset undergoing price discovery
* If one zooms out on the BTC/USD price chart, you
will see that it has increased by +31,296% since 2009,
averaged out to ~200% per year.
* The price swings reflect various news articles, regulatory updates, market demand, fear and excitement.
It’s a roller-coaster!
* **The longer you hodl, the more you learn and understand the fundamentals, and the more you realize
the profound implications of having sound money,
the less the price matters.**

>**In the end, ‘price’ won’t matter at all, as bitcoin
will be the unit of account.**

* **Disclaimer:**
* Only put in what you ‘can afford to lose’, since
there are, of course, no guarantees.
* Consider the bitcoin you buy as a long-term
savings account, and plan to leave it in cold
storage for a minimum of five years before
spending.

## IN THE MEANTIME, ON TAXES
* **Disclaimer:** This is not financial or tax advice

* In the US tax code, bitcoin is currently seen as a commodity, so there are potential tax implications if you
sell it back into fiat, or even if you buy something with
your bitcoin
* If the price went down before you sold/spent it, you
can claim a loss
* If the price went up, you are supposed to claim a
capital gain, and pay between 10-30% CGT (Capital
Gains Tax)
* The amount depends upon several factors, such as
how long you held it before selling or spending, and
in which tax bracket you land.
* If you plan to sell or spend bitcoin, especially larger
amounts, you may want to consider consulting with
a tax professional.
* If you simply buy and hold, you currently do not have
any taxable events regarding bitcoin.
* And if you buy non-KYC…

# Chapter 9

# WHY Bitcoin ONLY?
Of the over 2.5 million* (!) cryptocurrencies ever created,
and 13,000 currently trading, bitcoin is the only one that is:

* **TRULY decentralized**
* With a **TRULY distributed ledger**
* A **TRULY hard capped supply**
* A **TRULY immutable ledger**
* A **network effect** built over 15 years
* And a **monetary policy that cannot be manipulated!**
* Every other cryptocurrency has a **small, centralized
group who controls the supply, and/or has the
power to change the base layer protocol (monetary
policy).**
* **This is just like the central fiat banking system we
see today**
* Centralized power like this begs for manipulation and
corruption.
* See the altcoin pump/dump scam described on the
following page.
* **Listen to:**

---

## ALTCOIN PUMP AND DUMPS
* Sadly, these are real, and happen daily with ‘cryptos/tokens’ other than bitcoin.
* There are various iterations, but one of the most
common types is the following:

* **Token Created:** A new crypto token gets made. Far
easier than it sounds, anyone can do it in minutes.
* **Website:** Often, a shiny, fancy website is created to
make the token look legit.
* **Paid Influencers:** Paid to promote it on social media,
Telegram etc.
* **Paid Insider Groups:** The info is sent to leaders of
some of the hundreds of ‘Trading’ or ‘Investment’
Groups, where people pay monthly or annual fees to
get ‘insider intel’.
* **Pre-Launch:** The paid influencers and paid group leaders buy first, at the bottom price.
* **Launch:** The token is ‘launched’ by these influencers
and group leaders, who tell their followers: ”Quick,
buy now!”
* **Pump:** The price pumps fast as their followers scramble to get in early.
* The rapidly rising price entices regular people to buy
in, in the hopes of making their fortune.

---

* This in turn has the effect of pumping the price
even further.
* **Dump:** This sad part usually happens fast. At a certain
point, the paid group leaders sell their tokens, ‘at the
top’. Then they tell their followers to sell.
* **Price Drop:** Because so many people sell at the
same time, and liquidity is generally low since it is
a new coin, the price drops fast.
* **Panic:** The price drop causes panic amidst the general
public, who have no idea of these back-door shenanigans, and they start to panic-sell.
* **Bag Holders:** The end of this sad story is that those
left ‘holding the bag’, will likely be holding their bags
forever.
* Without any real value or fundamentals, most of these
tokens and meme coins never recover a market
price.

---

## SECURITY & AVOIDING SCAMS
* **Stick with bitcoin only.**
* **Be super vigilant** about your cyber security!
* **Do your own research** and **secure your bitcoin** with
utmost care.

>* **NEVER give your seed words to anyone you
wouldn’t give the key to for your stash of gold!**

* **NEVER click on any links** in your email that ask you
to confirm account details of any kind. **Instead, go
to the official website directly** and check if you have
any notices requiring any actions.
* **BE AWARE** that there are endless imitations of
accounts with large followings on social media. If an
influencer randomly DMs you, it is probably a scam.
* **AVOID all the scams popping up on social media**
accounts, promising to double your bitcoin if you
send some to them! You will lose your bitcoin!
* **AVOID those same ‘double your crypto’ scams** on
You Tube.
* **BE CERTAIN** about the address you are sending your
bitcoin to, as transactions are irreversible. Ideally
check the whole address, especially if it is a large
amount.

# SATOSHI’S NUMBERS 369 CLOCK

**Bitcoin is designed to mine 6 blocks per hour >> one block
on average every ~10 minutes.**

* 24 hours in a day

2+4=**6**

* That works out to 144 blocks per day

1+4+4=**9**

* 52560 blocks per year

5+2+5+6+0=18

1+8=**9**

* 52704 blocks per leap year

5+2+7+0+4=18

1+8=**9**

* 21 Million coins:

2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = **3**

* 33 Halvings:

3 + 3 =**6**

* Difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks:

2 + 0 + 1 + 6 = **9**

~ Based on a tweet by @level39 

* The block reward halving happens every
210,000th block (approximately every four years)
2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = **3**

---

>*“If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6 and 9, then
you would have the key to the universe.”
~ Nikola Tesla*

## BLOCK REWARD = % OF SUPPLY

* The block subsidy (number of bitcoins rewarded
for each newly mined block) represents **the
percentage of the total supply** that will be mined
during that epoch

* For example, the current block reward between
2024-2028 is **3.125** bitcoin.

* In these same four years, **3.125**% of the 21
million bitcoins will be mined.

## REWARD EPOCHS

* Every four years, the bitcoin subsidy gets halved for each
block mined. **A Reward Epoch is that four year period.**

* **Reward epoch 1:** 2009-2012 **Block subsidy:** 50 bitcoin
= (50 bitcoins * 210,000 blocks) = 10,500,000 bitcoin

1+0+5+0+0+0+0+0 = **6**

* **Reward epoch 2:** 2012-2016 **Block subsidy:** 25 bitcoin
= (25 * 210,000) = 5,250,000 bitcoin

5+2+5+0+0+0+0 = 12

1+2 = **3**

* **Reward epoch 3:** 2016-2020 **Block subsidy:** 12.5 bitcoin
= (12.5 * 210,000) = 2,625,000 bitcoin

2+6+2+5+0+0+0 = 15

1+5 = **6**

* **Reward epoch 4:** 2020-2024 **Block subsidy:** 6.25 bitcoin
= (6.25 * 210,000) = 1,312,500 bitcoin

1+3+1+2+5+0+0 = 12

1+2 = **3**

* **Reward epoch 5:** 2024-2028 **Block subsidy:** 3.125 bitcoin
= (3.125 * 210,000) = 656,250 bitcoin

6+5+6+2+5+0 = 24

2+4 = **6**

* **Reward epoch 7: 2032-2036 Block subsidy:** 0.78125 btc
= (0.78125*210,000) = 164,062.5 bitcoin

1+6+4+0+6+2+5 = 24

2+4 = **6**

**... and so on until 2140**

## SATOSHI’S BIRTHDAY

* ***April 5, 1975*** is the date Satoshi claimed as his
birthday.
* While we cannot know if this was indeed his true birth
date, it is very interesting.
* ***April 5th*** (1933) was the day that Executive Order 6102
was signed by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt
“forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion,
and gold certificates within the continental United
States.”
* ***1975*** was the year the repeal of EO 6102 went into
effect, and US citizens were once again allowed to
hold more than 5oz of gold.

## A NUMERIC PALINDROME 6102-2016

* ***6102*** was the number of the above-mentioned
Executive Order.
* ***2016*** is the number of blocks mined during each difficulty adjustment (approximately 2 weeks).

>* In both of the above examples, one could
postulate that Satoshi was using numbers
to indicate a reversal, **an unwinding of the
damage inflicted by government overreach.**

---

## BITCOIN PIZZA DAY

* May 22 is known as Bitcoin Pizza Day. This was the
day that a guy, named Laszlo Hanyecz, announced
on bitcointalkforum.org that he had successfully
traded 10,000 bitcoin for pizza! Back then that
was about $40.
* In today’s prices, that would be ~$610,000,000. 
* It was a milestone for bitcoin, in that it was the first
known incident of someone trading bitcoin for a
good or service. What a long way we have come!

## BT ~ BITCOIN TWITTER
Some cypherpunks, geniuses, goats & wild ones to follow!
Through these accounts, you will find 1000's of plebs
and other deep thinkers,
all on the journey.
BT, along with bitcointalk.org and Reddit, has largely been
where this experiment has grown,
and now joined by Nostr,
the decentralized communication protocol,
all unfurling in real time, across time and space,
in the ethers of cyberspace, connected to the physical,
through all of us,
humans,
sharing a vision of a decentralized world.
Then there are the quieter ones, developers working
behind the scenes
without whom
none of this would be possible.
All of us
together,
unleashed,
as bitcoin was unleashed upon us,
a blessing beyond measure.


**TOPICS INCLUDE:** Bitcoin, Proof-of-Work, Privacy, Philosophy,
Monetary History, Code, Bitcoin Mining, Sociology, Game
Theory, Austrian Economics, Bitcoin Education, Lightning
Network, Regulatory Environment, Bitcoin’s Energy Use,
Core Devs, Bitcoin Communities, Bitcoin’s Future and more.

**Be warned:** It helps to have a somewhat thick skin on twitter,
and know this, there is a lot of passion in defense of
bitcoin. Keeping a clear line between it and all the
altcoins takes work. Maintaining the clarity, security and
purity of the only truly sound money the world has ever
known is critical, if we are to have a chance in these times
a’coming.

## A RABBIT HOLE PONDERING

Bitcoin is really a rather fascinating ‘thing’

Except it is not a ‘thing’

In the sense that you cannot touch it

Yet it is touching millions of us

Around the world

Soon to be billions..

It is true that

It is digital bits and bytes

Algorithms and code

0’s and 1’s

And that if every single node

Archival node, pruned node and light node

Were somehow

Destroyed

It would no longer exist

In the way we know it

Are able to perceive it..

It would, however, still ‘exist’

In the sense that quantum physics

Or gravity

Exists

Regardless of human perception..

In the sense that mathematics existed

Before humans codified it

Chose symbols to represent it..

Truth

Does not need us

## WHY WILL ALL VALUE ACCRUE TO BITCOIN

There are some interesting game theories that appear
to converge when it comes to bitcoin, making the
likelihood of it’s growth and increased value over time
more and more certain.

## SCHELLING POINT

* Introduced in the 1960s by the American economist,
Thomas Schelling, the Schelling point basically asserts
that **people who cannot necessarily communicate
with one another, can still converge on a decision
or course of action, especially when a compelling
solution to a problem presents itself** (-> bitcoin)
* In addition, as more people are drawn to the Schelling
point, it attracts ever more people (-> bitcoin)

## LINDY EFFECT
* In essence, the Lindy Effect states **that the longer an
idea, a technology or a business has been around,
the longer it is likely to endure.**

## METCALFE’S LAW

* Popularized by Robert Metcalfe, who invented
Ethernet, among other things. Metcalfe’s law states
that **a network becomes proportionally more valuable the more users it has.** Utility increases exponentially as more and more users join, strengthening
the network.

## THE P2P NETWORK
>*It is a global distributed database, with
additions to the database by consent of
the majority...*

~ Satoshi Nakamoto 2009-02-18

Global reachable Bitcoin Nodes distribution, June 2024

>*The result is a distributed system with
no single point of failure. Users hold
the crypto keys to their own money and
transact directly with each other, with
the help of the P2P network to check for
double-spending.*

## BITCOIN, NONVIOLENT COMMUNICATION & PERMACULTURE

I see **Bitcoin,** brought to us by Satoshi Nakamoto, as being
the foundation layer for a healthy society with regards to:

* **communicating value**
* **transacting and exchanging**
* **storing our time/life energy**
in an emergent, organic, honest unfolding.

I see **Nonviolent Communication,** brought to us by Marshall
Rosenberg PhD, as the foundation layer for a healthy society
with regards to:

* **communicating feelings and needs**
* **deep listening, empathy**
* **finding co-creative solutions**
in an emergent, organic, honest unfolding.

I see **Natural Farming and Permaculture,** brought to us by
our Ancestors, and more recently, Masunobu Fukuoka and Bill
Mollison as being the foundation layer for a healthy society
with regards to:

* **communication with the earth**
* **growing food, healing the soil**
* **tending the wild**
in an emergent, organic and honest unfolding

---

Each of these technologies, one mathematical, taking
us beyond mathematics, one linguistic, taking us beyond
language, one biological, taking us beyond biology, are
based in Truth.

It is up to us to make use of them, to live into them, and
to allow them to guide us deeper and deeper into the
profound potential we feel tingling at the tip of
our perception.

**May we find the courage, the strength,
the wisdom and the grace
to move forth fearlessly
on the journey**

# Chapter 14

# A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto 

by Eric Hughes

**Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age.
Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one
doesn’t want the whole world to know, but a secret matter
is something one doesn’t want anybody to know. Privacy is
the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.**

If two parties have some sort of dealings, then each has
a memory of their interaction. Each party can speak about
their own memory of this; how could anyone prevent it? One
could pass laws against it, but the **freedom of speech, even
more than privacy, is fundamental to an open society;** we
seek not to restrict any speech at all. If many parties speak
together in the same forum, each can speak to all the others
and aggregate together knowledge about individuals and
other parties. The power of electronic communications has
enabled such group speech, and it will not go away merely
because we might want it to.

Since we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to
a transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly
necessary for that transaction. Since any information can be
spoken of, we must ensure that we reveal as little as possible.
In most cases personal identity is not salient. When I purchase
a magazine at a store and hand cash to the clerk, there is no
need to know who I am.

When I ask my electronic mail provider to send and receive
messages, my provider need not know to whom I am speaking or what I am saying or what others are saying to me; my
provider only need know how to get the message there and
how much I owe them in fees. When my identity is revealed
by the underlying mechanism of the transaction, I have no
privacy. I cannot here selectively reveal myself; I must always
reveal myself.

---

Therefore, **privacy in an open society requires anonymous
transaction systems. Until now, cash has been the primary
such system. An anonymous transaction system is not a
secret transaction system. An anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when desired and only
when desired; this is the essence of privacy.**

Privacy in an open society also requires cryptography. If I say
something, I want it heard only by those for whom I intend it.
If the content of my speech is available to the world, I have
no privacy. To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy,
and to encrypt with weak cryptography is **to indicate not too
much desire for privacy. Furthermore, to reveal one’s identity
with assurance when the default is anonymity requires the
cryptographic signature.** We cannot expect governments,
corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant
us privacy out of their beneficence

It is to their advantage to speak of us, and we should expect
that they will speak. To try to prevent their speech is to fight
against the realities of information. Information does not just
want to be free, it longs to be free. Information expands to fill
the available storage space. Information is Rumor’s younger,
stronger cousin; Information is fleeter of foot, has more eyes,
knows more, and understands less than Rumor.

**We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any.**
We must come together and create systems which allow
anonymous transactions to take place. People have been
defending their own privacy for centuries with whispers,
darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret handshakes, and
couriers. The technologies of the past did not allow for strong
privacy, but electronic technologies do.

**We the Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous
systems. We are defending our privacy with cryptography,**
with anonymous mail forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic money.

---

**Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to
write software to defend privacy, and since we can’t get
privacy unless we all do, we’re going to write it.** We
publish
our code so that our fellow Cypherpunks may practice and
play with it.

**Our code is free for all to use, worldwide.** We don’t much
care if you don’t approve of the software we write. We
know that software can’t be destroyed and that a widely
dispersed system can’t be shut down.

Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for
encryption is fundamentally a private act. The act of
encryp-tion, in fact, removes information from the public
realm. Even laws against cryptography reach only so far as a
nation’s bor-der and the arm of its violence.

Cryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe,
and with it the anonymous transactions systems that it
makes possible.

**For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social
con-tract. People must come and together deploy these
systems for the common good.** Privacy only extends so
far as the cooperation of one’s fellows in society. We the
Cypherpunks seek your questions and your concerns and
hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive
ourselves. We will not, however, be moved out of our
course because some may disagree with our goals.

The Cypherpunks are actively engaged in making the networks safer for privacy. Let us proceed together apace.
Onward.

# The Bitcoin White Paper
Presented to the world on metzdowd.com
2008-10-31

**by Satoshi Nakamoto**

A pseudonymous cypherpunk, who last communicated
with the cypherpunk community on the bitcointalk.org
forum on 2010-12-10.

By leaving, he allowed Bitcoin to be a true experiment in
the wild. Everyone who works on it is a volunteer in some
sense <-> inspired by the potential of freeing humanity
from the shackles of a manipulated, debt-based money
system, and instead, participating in a global, trustless,
permissionless, censorship-resistant, truly scarce, peer-topeer, decentralized money and monetary payment network, that is inspiring an emergent order to rise out of the
fiat ashes

**We are all Satoshi**
>*The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink
of second bailout for banks*

~ Text of a headline from The Times of London,
etched into the Bitcoin Genesis block by Satoshi
Nakamoto on 2009-01-03

# NOSTR

![](figure-044-nostr.png)

## NOSTR & OTHER STUFF TRANSMITTED BY RELAYS

>*One could pass laws against it, but the freedom of
speech, even more than privacy, is fundamental to an
open society; we seek not to restrict any speech at all.*

~ Eric Hughes, The Cypherpunk's manifesto, 1993

## WHAT IS NOSTR

>*TL;DR: nostr is a protocol that has the power to
replace twitter, Telegram, and other things.*

~ @dergigi 

>*nostr is to freedom of communication
as bitcoin is to freedom of transaction.*

~ Keysa @SimplestBitcoinBook

* **Nostr is a simple, decentralized protocol for
censorship-resistant, global, interoperable networks.**
* Nostr does not rely on a trusted central server.
* It is a free and open source (FOSS) software protocol,
like Bitcoin, HTTP or TCP-IP, which allows anyone to
build on nostr.
* **It is how we retain our freedom to communicate**
with anyone, anywhere with an internet connection.

>*(it is) a communications protocol with a
self-sovereign identity layer...
and nostr is also more than that.* 

~ @dergigi

---

## WHY WE NEED NOSTR

We need nostr because the current communication
systems and social media platforms are centralized.

**This is problematic because these systems:**

* Have the power to censor your speech.
* Are vulnerable to regulatory attacks by the state.
* Can choose, or be told, to suspend or delete your
account.
* Can be hacked, and thus compromise your data.
* Use algorithms to feed you the information they want
you to see.
* Manipulate every aspect of your experience on them.
* Track all your activity.
* Harvest and sell your data.
* Use your data to litter your feed with advertisements.

---

## HOW DOSE NOSTR WORK

* **Nostr has two parts:** Clients and Relays.
* **A CLIENT is an INTERFACE** (app or website) that is run
on the nostr protocol. 
* **It is where you see the notes** that you and the people
you follow post (in the same way that twitter is an
interface where you post and read notes by others,
except twitter is centralized & it censors posts.)
* **A RELAY is a SERVER and a DATABASE.** Anyone can
run a relay, which is what makes nostr decentralized.
* **t is where your notes are sent, stored and retrieved
from** by clients.
* There are many relays and you can choose which ones
to connect to. Some are free and some are paid.
* When you post a message, it is broadcast to the relays
you are connected to.
* The clients query the relays they are connected to, and
then they populate the messages being hosted by
those relays.

![publish](figure-045-publish.png)

~ @BTCillustrated

---

>*Anyone can run a relay. A relay is very simple and
dumb. It does nothing besides accepting posts
from some people and forwarding to others.
Relays don’t have to be trusted.
Signatures are verified on the client side.*

~ @fiatjaf, 2019-11-02 fiatjaf.com/nostr.html

* When you open your nostr client, you will see all the
notes posted by you and those you follow in
chronological order.
* There are no **algorithms** deciding what to show you,
what to withhold from you, or censoring your posts.
* Like Bitcoin, **nostr uses public/private key pairs.**
* **PUBLIC KEY** = npub, like a username
* **PRIVATE KEY** = nsec, like a password

>* **NOTE:** Your private key cannot be reset if
>lost, so you **must secure it well!**
>* If you leak your private key, whoever has
>access to it has access to your nostr
>account, and **there is no way to regain
>sole access.**

---

* You can create a human-readable username using
NIP-05. **For example:**
* **My Public Key, or npub is:**
<small>npub1dpna3xwwddnhhzg9ycpvlcz2ze0jdwm2rf3eqd2lf9leaewtq7tqhw0ef2</small>

* **My NIP-05 Nostr address is:**

SimplestBitcoinBook@nostrplebs.com

* **You can search for people on nostr** by entering their:
*  npub
*  NIP-05 (aka nostr address) if they have one
*  Username from NIP-05 -> @SimplestBitcoinBook

* **Get a NIP-05 Identifier here:**
* nostrplebs.com
* verified-nostr.com
* getalby.com
* Or set one up with your own domain

* Once you have your nostr key pair, you can log into any
nostr client with those same keys, and you will see that
you **retain your identity and followers/following lists
on all the clients.**
* This differs from legacy social media, where you need a
separate account, username and password for each
platform, and you have different content, follows and
followers on each one. 
>*At it's most basic level, Nostr is a communication
protocol that acts as the social glue that binds
all of your apps together.*

~ derekross@nostrplebs.com

# HOW TO NOSTR

>1. **Choose a client** app to download. (It doesn't matter
which one you select, as you can try them all out once
you have your key pair generated.)
>2. **Popular Client Examples:**
>* Damus on iOS
>* Amethyst on Android
>* Primal on iOS/Android/Desktop
>3. **Create a User Name.** No other info is needed.
>4. **The app will generate the account.**
>5. **You can add a profile picture and banner** if you like.
>6. **Your account will automatically connect to a few
relays** once you select at least one interest (eg:
bitcoin, art, human rights, sports, music etc)
>7. Depending on the client, it will automatically follow a
few accounts with a similar interest, or let you select a
few.
>8. **You can then add or remove relays and accounts.**

## KEY MANAGEMENT
* Once your keys have been generated, it is time to
install a **signing extension.**
* When you want to log in to a website running on the
nostr protocol, it will ask for your nsec, or private key.
* **DO NOT** enter it directly, as websites can leak data
* **Instead, always use a signing extension.**
* This is a tool which stores your private key, and you
authorize it to sign events, such as notes, on your
behalf. Don't worry, this is simpler than it sounds!
* **Popular signing extensions:**
* Nostore (iOS Safari)
* Amber (Android)
* Nsec App (Mobile/Desktop)
* Alby (Desktop)
* Nos2X (Desktop)
* Nostr Connect (Desktop)

## ZAPS
* Zapping is how we bitcoin on nostr! Creating a V4V
(Value4Value) economy, note by note, zap by zap.
* You can send and receive sats (aka zaps) for notes or
content you appreciate by connecting a Bitcoin
Lightning wallet to your nostr account.
* There are various ways to do this. If the client you
choose doesn't walk you through it, just ask on nostr
with the #asknostr tag, and someone will guide you.
Nostriches are friendly

## WHY THE OSTRICH?

![ostrich](figure-047-ostrich.png)

**The Nostrich Origin Story**

by Walker@primal.net

**December 16, 2022:**

I discovered ChatGPT3 and,
naturally, asked it
“Can you write a joke about #nostr?”
ChatGPT3 responded:
Q: What do you call a nosy ostrich?
A: A nosTrich!
The joke wasn’t great, but you can’t blame a bot. Regardless, I
loved the idea of a visual identity for nostr, and ostriches are
cool birds. So I took to Midjourney and created The #Nostrich

**December 20, 2022:**

@jb55 proposed the “Nostrich” as the official Nostr mascot
and logo.
Three minutes later, @jack tweets the Nostrich image.
The rest, as they say, is history.

## JOIN US
* Nostr is still very young. Just like bitcoin, but much
younger, it is a grassroots, messy, global, ground-up
experiment.
* If you see the value in a decentralized, censorshipresistant, open-source communications protocol,
please join us in using it, developing it, offering
feedback to the devs, and participating in whatever
way you feel called, to help grow this free speech tool.
* It is an amazing experience to engage in a growing
technology that is built to preserve freedom of speech
and open communication globally.
* Dive in and learn along with the rest of us sovereign
souls, embracing the inherent chaos to create beauty,
and to forge a bright future for our grandchildren!

*More important than all is that we must keep in mind that
nostr is just a very loose set of servers with basically no
connection between them, ... and the process of keeping
connected to others and finding content must be
addressed through many different hackish attempts. To
write Nostr applications and to use Nostr one
must embrace the inherent chaos.*
